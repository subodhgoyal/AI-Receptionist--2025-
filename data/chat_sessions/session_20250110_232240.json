        "assistant": "Hello! Thank you for reaching out to us. We accept most insurances and offer direct billing, which means we electronically submit your insurance papers and accept payment directly from your insurance company. However, there are a few insurance providers that don\u2019t allow payment to come to our office. In those cases, full payment for services will be required.\n\nRest assured, your treatment will always be based on your dental needs, regardless of your dental plan coverage. If you have a specific insurance company in mind, feel free to let me know, and I can provide more details. \n\nIf there's anything else you\u2019d like to ask, please don\u2019t hesitate! We\u2019re here to help.",
