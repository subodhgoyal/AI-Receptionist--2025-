        "assistant": "Hello again! Thank you for your question about insurance. We accept most insurances and offer direct billing, which means we can submit your insurance papers electronically and accept payment directly from your insurance company. However, there are a few insurance companies that don\u2019t allow payment to come to our office; in those cases, full payment for services would be required. \n\nOur priority is always to provide treatment based on your dental needs, regardless of your dental plan coverage. If you have a specific insurance provider in mind or need more details, I can certainly have a member of our team reach out to you. \n\nIs there anything else you\u2019d like to know? We\u2019re here to help!",
