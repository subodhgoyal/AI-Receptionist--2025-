DENTAL SERVICES
GENERAL DENTISTRY
​
If you're looking for a dental office that employs friendly and helpful staff, BayWell Dental is a practice worth visiting. Our dentists were trained at the University of Toronto and are dedicated to staying current with new advancements and techniques to benefit your teeth and enhance your smile. Our practice was established in 1973, and ever since we've been committed to providing exceptional dental care.
EMERGENCY DENTISTRY
​
Dental problems don't always happen during regularly scheduled office hours. This can be disruptive and can range from a minor inconvenience to severe pain. It may happen in the form of a chipped tooth, broken filling, oral trauma, infection and possibly swelling. Here at BayWell Dental, we offer flexible morning and evening hours, including Saturdays to accommodate your emergency needs.
DENTAL CLEANINGS & PREVENTIVE CARE
​
Regular dental checkups and cleanings are essential to maintaining your oral health. During your cleaning appointment, your hygienist and dentist will inspect for signs of tooth decay, gum disease, gum recession and tooth wear. They will do an preliminary oral cancer screen and assess other problems that you may not even be aware of. This is all in addition to providing a thorough cleaning and polish. Our goal is to help you maintain a healthy smile by designing a periodontal program to suit your needs. If its been more than 6 months, call us to book a cleaning and check up today!
IMPLANTS
​
Dental implants have revolutionized the way we restore missing teeth. A dental implant is a bone friendly titanium post that is placed into the missing tooth socket. The implant then integrates permanently with your own jaw bone. After a few months, you are then able to receive a crown placed directly onto your implant. Implants are an excellent way to restore missing teeth with a natural and aesthetic result.
VENEERS
​
Are you interested in enhancing your smile? Veeners are an excellent option and are one the least invasive ways to dramatically change your smile and provide long lasting results. Veneers are a thin, customized layer of porcelain that are bonded over your front teeth to create an extremely natural and aesthetic smile. Together, you and your dentist will design a smile with beautiful teeth that complements your face shape and size. Ask us how we can help you achieve the smile you always wanted.
WHITENING
​
Many people associate professional teeth whitening with movie stars and brides. But in fact, it is an extremely popular procedure in cosmetic dentistry. And at BayWell Dental Centre, we offer the most current teeth whitening services to achieve immediate results in just one hour of chair time.
WISDOM TEETH EXTRACTION
​
The extraction of wisdom teeth is necessary when they are prevented from properly erupting into the mouth. They may grow sideways, partially emerge in the mouth, and even remain trapped beneath the gum within the jaw. These impacted teeth can eventually cause severe infections, cavities and shift other teeth. The most serious complications occur when tumors or cysts form around the impacted wisdom teeth, resulting in the destruction of the jawbone and healthy adjacent teeth. The early removal of the third molar tooth usually avoids these problems and decreases surgical risks involved with the procedure. This can be done at our office with or without sedation depending on patient specific need and preference.
DIGITAL X-RAYS
​
Our digital x-rays reduce exposure by over 85% and is eco-friendly through reducing the use of chemicals to process film the traditional way. Digital x-rays are viewed instantly on the computer monitor in each operatory in our office. This improves the way we diagnose disease and allows us to better communicate with you to make treatment decisions together.
COSMETIC DENTISTRY
​
Years ago, aesthetic improvements in dentistry often meant multiple appointments and invasive procedures. But thanks to advances in cosmetic dentistry, dental professionals these days are able to help patients achieve spectacular results in a far less painful and time-consuming fashion.
BONDING AND WHITE FILLINGS
​
Many of us have gaps between the teeth. This may be a concern in the front teeth particularly. To close these gaps several options may be chosen. At times a porcelain veneer or laminate may be recommended to close the gaps. At other times bonding, or a white filling material, may be recommended to do the same.
BRIDGES
​
A bridge can be an excellent way to replace a missing tooth. The replacement tooth is permanent fixed to the neighbouring teeth and "bridged" together to close the space. This prevents drifting and movement of your natural teeth. A dental bridge can also be a great alternative for patients who are not candidates for implants, due to insufficient bone quantity or quality. Bridges can be made of a variety of materials, including porcelain and alloys, depending on your needs and preferences.
CROWNS
​
Dental crowns may be recommended by your dentist to restore fractured, chipped, or worn down teeth. They may also be necessary to prevent weak teeth from splitting/fracturing, especially ones that have received root canal treatment. There are many different options for modern crowns that can look extremely natural and beautiful, ranging from traditional porcelain & metal crowns, to All Ceramic Porcelain and Zirconia crowns. Ask us about CEREC Crowns and same day service!
ROOT CANAL TREATMENT
​
Root canal treatment may be recommended by your dentist to save your tooth from an infected, or dying nerve. This may sound scary to some people, but at our office, we make sure that you are completely numb, or frozen before we proceed with any treatment. This results in a painless procedure to remove the infection and save you from losing your tooth. Your dentist may recommend a crown after a root canal procedure to preserve the integrity of the tooth for long term success.
GUM GRAFTS
​
Gum grafting is a procedure to develop gum tissue where absent due to excessive gum recession from abrasive brushing techniques or gum disease. Receding gums can cause inflammation, tooth sensitivity and an uneven smile line. Your dentist can use a gum graft to cover the exposed root. This can be done for one tooth or several teeth to even your gum line and reduce sensitivity.
TEETH STRAIGHTENING
​
If you want to improve your smile and want healthy, straight, teeth - ask us if you are candidate for orthodontic treatment with Suresmile Clear aligners. Designed for the modern patient, these aligners will help you achieve your ideal smile fast, effectively and more discrete than ever. We will work with you to create a customized plan, and depending on the scope, treatment may take only 6-8 months.
THE STUDENT DISCOUNT DENTAL NETWORK
At Baywell Dental Centre, we are proud to be apart of the Greenshield Student Discount Network Program. If you are a student participating in a university or college dental plan, such as University of Toronto, George Brown, Ryerson, York, or OCAD, you are eligible to receive preventive care at a reduce fee. Some procedures require a co-payment if they are partially subsidized. For other dental services, there may be a co-payment if they are partially subsidized. Call us at (416) 961-6630 to find out more!
THERAPEUTIC BOTOX AND TMD
What’s involved in Therapeutic Botox® TMJ treatment?

Botox® can be injected into the temporalis and masseter muscles and works by blocking nerve signals that cause uncontrollable muscle movements, eventually relaxing the muscles. You can expect results 2-3 weeks from the time of treatment and it can remain effective for anywhere between two and six months depending on the patient. After several treatments, patients report a decreased need for touch ups and this will depend on the severity of your condition as well as metabolism.

Benefits and Risks of Therapeutic Botox® treatment

Therapeutic Botox® injections can often provide substantial relief to those suffering from soreness and pain of the TMJ while reducing the ability of muscles to engage in problematic grinding, which can also slow down worn down teeth. The potential side effects of Therapeutic Botox® treatment are mild, and usually go away within a few hours or days after treatment. Potential side effects include: inflammation, bleeding, bruising, swelling, muscle weakness, pain at injection site and allergic reactions.

Is it covered by my insurance?

Many insurances do cover Therapeutic Botox in the treatment of TMD. Our staff are experienced with submitting estimates and can do so on your behalf to assist you, just ask us!
WISDOM TOOTH REMOVAL
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUTWISDOM TEETH
A Wisdom Tooth Extraction is a routine surgical procedure to remove one or more wisdom teeth — the four permanent adult teeth that are the last to erupt at the back of your mouth. If a wisdom tooth does not have room to grow, it is considered an “impacted wisdom tooth,” and this can result in pain, infection, or another dental problem. They present between the ages of 17 – 25, and often cause discomfort due to lack of room in the jaw or angle of entry.
We use X-rays to carefully assess the problem and, if necessary, plan for extraction. Wisdom teeth are usually easier to remove at a younger (17-25) age because there is a greater probability that the roots have not fully developed and the bone surrounding the teeth is typically less dense.
​
Problems with Impacted Wisdom Teeth Include:
Pain

Trapping of food and debris behind and around the wisdom tooth

Is Wisdom Teeth Removal Really Necessary?
It depends. We evaluate every patient on an individual basis to determine how the presence of your wisdom teeth are affecting your oral health. If you have wisdom teeth that are causing dental problems, our team will discuss the benefits of removing them.If you have impacted wisdom teeth that are not causing dental problems (asymptomatic), we will discuss the pros and cons of preventive extraction. In either case, the decision is ultimately up to the patient.
​
Can’t I just wait until my wisdom teeth hurt?
You can, but there are important benefits to removing your wisdom teeth while you are in the ideal age range(17-25) that you should be aware of:
Younger adults usually do not have fully formed wisdom teeth, which makes them easier to remove
Younger adults usually do not have fully formed wisdom teeth, which makes them easier to remove
Younger adults tend to heal and recover quickly

Older adults may experience more difficulty with surgery and complications after surgery.
Older adults may experience more difficulty with surgery and complications after surgery.

What are the risks of the procedure?
Most procedures are routine and serious complications are not expected. Any problems that do happen are usually minor and can be treated. Complications can include:
Pain, swelling, limited mouth opening, bleeding - these are all normal and improves after the first few days

Nerve injury - loss of feeling, a change in feeling, or pain in the lips, chin or tongue, caused by a wisdom tooth (usually a lower one) being close to a nerve.If your panoramic X-ray shows that your wisdom tooth is close to a nerve, there is about a 20% risk of temporary injury (most heal within 6 months) and about a 2% risk of permanent injury.When concerned about the location of the nerve, a 3D Xray can be taken to determine the precise proximity of the root/nerve.

Sedation Options to Address Dental Anxiety
A wisdom tooth extraction can be a stressful experience for many patients. We offer minimal conscious sedation and oral moderate sedation to relieve anxiety and improve patient experience.
Minimal sedation (Laughing Gas): Depending on the dose administered, this is a relaxed state where patients can walk, talk, and breathe normally. Patients are not asleep.
Minimal sedation (Laughing Gas): Depending on the dose administered, this is a relaxed state where patients can walk, talk, and breathe normally. Patients are not asleep.
Moderate sedation (Twilight Sedation): This is a modestly deeper sedation. Patients will be able to talk and respond to questions but will feel more drowsy. Depending on the medications used, a patient may or may not remember the procedure.
Moderate sedation (Twilight Sedation): This is a modestly deeper sedation. Patients will be able to talk and respond to questions but will feel more drowsy. Depending on the medications used, a patient may or may not remember the procedure.

We use sedation for various surgical procedures and provide instructions for eating and drinking before and after treatment. Following your appointment, patients will need to return home accompanied by a responsible adult. To ensure complete safety, you will be monitored throughout the entire procedure by our team.
​
Wisdom Tooth Surgery Healing Time
The healing process after wisdom tooth removal surgery can vary from 7 to 10 days. Depending on the circumstances, brushing, eating, and other actions can be resumed the next day. A follow-up visit is scheduled with your dentist to assess and assist as needed with your recovery and address any post surgical concerns.As you heal from your surgery, we recommend that you follow your dentist’s instructions on:
Bleeding. Some oozing of blood may occur the first day after wisdom tooth removal. Try to avoid excessive spitting so that you do not dislodge the blood clot from the socket. Replace gauze over the extraction site as directed by your dentist or oral surgeon.

Pain management. You may be able to manage pain with an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), or a prescription pain medication from your dentist. Prescription pain medication may be especially helpful if bone has been removed during the procedure. Holding a cold pack against your jaw also may relieve pain.

WISDOM TOOTH REMOVAL
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUTWISDOM TEETH
A Wisdom Tooth Extraction is a routine surgical procedure to remove one or more wisdom teeth — the four permanent adult teeth that are the last to erupt at the back of your mouth. If a wisdom tooth does not have room to grow, it is considered an “impacted wisdom tooth,” and this can result in pain, infection, or another dental problem. They present between the ages of 17 – 25, and often cause discomfort due to lack of room in the jaw or angle of entry.
We use X-rays to carefully assess the problem and, if necessary, plan for extraction. Wisdom teeth are usually easier to remove at a younger (17-25) age because there is a greater probability that the roots have not fully developed and the bone surrounding the teeth is typically less dense.
​
Problems with Impacted Wisdom Teeth Include:
Pain

Is Wisdom Teeth Removal Really Necessary?
It depends. We evaluate every patient on an individual basis to determine how the presence of your wisdom teeth are affecting your oral health. If you have wisdom teeth that are causing dental problems, our team will discuss the benefits of removing them.If you have impacted wisdom teeth that are not causing dental problems (asymptomatic), we will discuss the pros and cons of preventive extraction. In either case, the decision is ultimately up to the patient.
​
Can’t I just wait until my wisdom teeth hurt?
You can, but there are important benefits to removing your wisdom teeth while you are in the ideal age range(17-25) that you should be aware of:
Younger adults usually do not have fully formed wisdom teeth, which makes them easier to remove
Younger adults usually do not have fully formed wisdom teeth, which makes them easier to remove
Younger adults tend to heal and recover quickly

Older adults may experience more difficulty with surgery and complications after surgery.
Older adults may experience more difficulty with surgery and complications after surgery.

What are the risks of the procedure?
Most procedures are routine and serious complications are not expected. Any problems that do happen are usually minor and can be treated. Complications can include:
Pain, swelling, limited mouth opening, bleeding - these are all normal and improves after the first few days

Nerve injury - loss of feeling, a change in feeling, or pain in the lips, chin or tongue, caused by a wisdom tooth (usually a lower one) being close to a nerve.If your panoramic X-ray shows that your wisdom tooth is close to a nerve, there is about a 20% risk of temporary injury (most heal within 6 months) and about a 2% risk of permanent injury.When concerned about the location of the nerve, a 3D Xray can be taken to determine the precise proximity of the root/nerve.

Sedation Options to Address Dental Anxiety
A wisdom tooth extraction can be a stressful experience for many patients. We offer minimal conscious sedation and oral moderate sedation to relieve anxiety and improve patient experience.
Minimal sedation (Laughing Gas): Depending on the dose administered, this is a relaxed state where patients can walk, talk, and breathe normally. Patients are not asleep.
Minimal sedation (Laughing Gas): Depending on the dose administered, this is a relaxed state where patients can walk, talk, and breathe normally. Patients are not asleep.
Moderate sedation (Twilight Sedation): This is a modestly deeper sedation. Patients will be able to talk and respond to questions but will feel more drowsy. Depending on the medications used, a patient may or may not remember the procedure.
Moderate sedation (Twilight Sedation): This is a modestly deeper sedation. Patients will be able to talk and respond to questions but will feel more drowsy. Depending on the medications used, a patient may or may not remember the procedure.

We use sedation for various surgical procedures and provide instructions for eating and drinking before and after treatment. Following your appointment, patients will need to return home accompanied by a responsible adult. To ensure complete safety, you will be monitored throughout the entire procedure by our team.
​
Wisdom Tooth Surgery Healing Time
The healing process after wisdom tooth removal surgery can vary from 7 to 10 days. Depending on the circumstances, brushing, eating, and other actions can be resumed the next day. A follow-up visit is scheduled with your dentist to assess and assist as needed with your recovery and address any post surgical concerns.As you heal from your surgery, we recommend that you follow your dentist’s instructions on:
Bleeding. Some oozing of blood may occur the first day after wisdom tooth removal. Try to avoid excessive spitting so that you do not dislodge the blood clot from the socket. Replace gauze over the extraction site as directed by your dentist or oral surgeon.

They get in each others way! This leads to increased wear and tear on your teeth leading to chipping and cracks
Patients often think orthodontic treatment is only for children but that is just not true! Modern technology using Clear aligners is gaining popularity because it is discrete, fast, and effective. It is perfect for the adult patient who wants straight healthy teeth and designed to fit your lifestyle. If you want healthy teeth that will last you a lifetime, consider a conversation with our dentists to see how SureSmile Aligners can help you achieve that. It is the ultimate preventive treatment and can save you time, money and unwanted visits to the dentist in the future.
How SureSmile clear aligner therapy works
In order to know where your teeth need to go, your dentist will spend time thoughtfully designing a Digital Diagnostic Tooth Setup encompassing the principles of an ideal bite (occlusion), gum health, skeletal proportions and space restrictions. We then order a series of custom-fabricated aligners designed apply a light pressure on your teeth and promotes tooth movement into their ideal position gradually. You will wear your aligners for 20 to 22 hours per day and switch them out for the next tray approximately every two weeks.
SureSmile Aligners are loved by patients and dentists alike because it is:
Effective: because the aligners are fabricated based on advanced computer technology, the aligners create precise movements while requiring fewer adjustments than traditional braces
Effective: because the aligners are fabricated based on advanced computer technology, the aligners create precise movements while requiring fewer adjustments than traditional braces
Versatile: SureSmile is a great option for a wide variety of misalignment issues ranging from crowding, overbite, deep bites, spacing and more.It can also be used to move teeth into ideal positions prior to major restorative work like crowns or veneers in order to minimize tooth reduction (this requires a more complex explanation….ask Dr. Luong for more details).

How do I get started?
The first step towards getting the straight, healthy smile you’ve always wanted is to schedule your initial consultation. During your consultation, we will talk with you about your goals for your smile, evaluate your bite and tooth alignment, and establish if you are a good candidate for treatment in our care. We will have a conversation about the pros and cons of treatment, and any limitations that exist for your case. Once the decision is made to move forward, we take a digital scan of your mouth so that we can begin planning your treatment. After your digital tooth set up is complete, our dentists will review the and obtain input from you. Once we have your approval, the laboratory will begin fabricating your aligners based on our precise specifications. Once they are ready, you will pick up your aligners and then return for monthly checkup appointments until your treatment plan is complete. Overall, treatment typically takes between six months to one year, depending on the severity of your case. When your treatment is complete, we will give you a retainer to wear at night so you can maintain your terrific results.
To schedule your SureSmile consultation at Baywell Dental, call our Toronto, ON office today at(416) 961-6630!

A consult is complimentary for our existing patients.

For new patients, a consult is $150 and includes a full set of orthodontic photographs and a panorex radiograph.

Therapeutic Botox Injections for TMJ
THERAPUTIC BOTOX INJECTIONSFOR TMD
Do you suffer from muscle tension and headaches? Are you clenching and grinding?
Therapeutic Botox® treatment for TMJ and Jaw Tension may be the treatment you were looking for. You may have heard about Therapeutic Botox in the treatment of jaw pain and tension headaches from clenching and grinding. Perhaps you have already tried traditional remedies such as night guards, massages, and anti-inflammatory medications, and are still in pain. Therapeutic Botox is considered a novel treatment to address jaw pain. We have compiled a list of FAQ's to help answer your questions about this procedure.
What is TMD?
The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is located on both sides of your head where the jaw bone meets the skull. This joint is used when talking, eating, swallowing and other daily activities. When this joint becomes overworked through excessive grinding or clenching, you may suffer severe tension headaches, sharp pain of the jaw, facial muscle aches and even pain/sensitivity in your teeth. When you have pain in the jaw joint, we call this TMD, or Temporomandibular Disorder.
What is Therapeutic Botox® and how does it help my TMJ?

Botox® is commonly used to lessen the tell-tale signs of aging, such as wrinkles and frown lines, however recently these injections are being used more frequently in dental procedures as an alternative treatment for TMJ, tension headaches, clenching/grinding and sleep bruxism. Therapeutic Botox® relieves tension by making the muscle unable to engage in the powerful, often unconscious movement. Patients who have received injections experience significant improvements in pain, function, ability to open their mouth and levels of tenderness.
​
What’s involved in Therapeutic Botox® TMJ treatment?
Botox® can be injected into the temporalis and masseter muscles and works by blocking nerve signals that cause uncontrollable muscle movements, eventually relaxing the muscles. You can expect results 2-3 weeks from the time of treatment and it can remain effective for anywhere between two and six months depending on the patient. After several treatments, patients report a decreased need for touch ups and this will depend on the severity of your condition as well as metabolism.
​
Benefits and Risks of Therapeutic Botox® treatment
Therapeutic Botox® injections can often provide substantial relief to those suffering from soreness and pain of the TMJ while reducing the ability of muscles to engage in problematic grinding, which can also slow down worn down teeth.The potential side effects of Therapeutic Botox® treatment are mild, and usually go away within a few hours or days after treatment. Potential side effects include: inflammation, bleeding, bruising, swelling, muscle weakness, pain at injection site and allergic reactions.

Is it covered by my insurance?
Many insurances do cover Therapeutic Botox in the treatment of TMD. Our staff are experienced with submitting estimates and can do so on your behalf to assist you, just ask us!

DENTISTRY AND COVID-19
April 27, 2021
​
The Government's Stay at Home Order does not alter the scope of care that dentists are permitted to provide. Dentistry is an essential service and we remain open to care for our patients. We continue to be vigilant and adhere to the strictest of protocols to ensure our patients and staff are protected. As always, the safety of our patients remains our number one priority. Double screening, temperature recording, sealed operatories, adequate airflow with HVAC certification, air purifiers in every room, PPE, n95 respirators and thorough disinfection per IPAC protocols, always.
November 25, 2020
​
As Toronto enters Grey – Lockdown phase, we updated our COVID Protocols to ensure we continue to deliver safe dental care. We have had our HVAC system assessed and certified that our clinic receives adequate air flow and ventilation. Floor to ceiling vinyl doors have been installed to separate operatories, and we continue to observe wait time between patients to ensure time for the proper air exchange to occur in between patients. We are staying vigilant and are advocating for the safety of our staff and patients!
OUR DENTAL OFFICE RE-OPENS JUNE 15TH TO RESUME PATIENT CARE!

QUESTIONS PATIENTS MAY HAVE REGARDING THE DENTAL OFFICE AND COVID-19
Dr. Jeanie Luong discusses and Dentistry and COVID Q&A with Charlotte from Opencare. She discusses how to see a dentist during COVID, how to avoid an emergency, and what your visit might look like when dental offices re-open.
HOW TO AVOID DENTAL EMERGENCIES DURING COVID-19
1. Avoid chewing hard foods, especially if you have large fillings or crowns. Weakened tooth structure has a higher risk of cracking. Hold off on items such as nuts, crusty bread, bones and ice. If in doubt, skip it.
2. Moderate consumption of acidic beverages. Repeated insults from acidic beverage such as juice, beer, wine, pop, and sports drinks can erode enamel and cause sensitivity. Be mindful of how frequent your consumption is.
3. Brush gently around your gums. There is repeated messaging about brushing well during COVID, but make sure not to overdo it. Be kind to your gums and take your time to brush gently. Make sure to always use a soft or extra soft toothbrush.
Despite your best efforts, you may have a dental issue that requires consultation and treatment. Contact Dr. Luong or Dr. Sydney Cormier for advice atcontact@baywelldental.com

DENTAL SERVICES
GENERAL DENTISTRY
​
If you're looking for a dental office that employs friendly and helpful staff, BayWell Dental is a practice worth visiting. Our dentists were trained at the University of Toronto and are dedicated to staying current with new advancements and techniques to benefit your teeth and enhance your smile. Our practice was established in 1973, and ever since we've been committed to providing exceptional dental care.
EMERGENCY DENTISTRY
​
Dental problems don't always happen during regularly scheduled office hours. This can be disruptive and can range from a minor inconvenience to severe pain. It may happen in the form of a chipped tooth, broken filling, oral trauma, infection and possibly swelling. Here at BayWell Dental, we offer flexible morning and evening hours, including Saturdays to accommodate your emergency needs.
DENTAL CLEANINGS & PREVENTIVE CARE
​
Regular dental checkups and cleanings are essential to maintaining your oral health. During your cleaning appointment, your hygienist and dentist will inspect for signs of tooth decay, gum disease, gum recession and tooth wear. They will do an preliminary oral cancer screen and assess other problems that you may not even be aware of. This is all in addition to providing a thorough cleaning and polish. Our goal is to help you maintain a healthy smile by designing a periodontal program to suit your needs. If its been more than 6 months, call us to book a cleaning and check up today!
IMPLANTS
​
Dental implants have revolutionized the way we restore missing teeth. A dental implant is a bone friendly titanium post that is placed into the missing tooth socket. The implant then integrates permanently with your own jaw bone. After a few months, you are then able to receive a crown placed directly onto your implant. Implants are an excellent way to restore missing teeth with a natural and aesthetic result.
VENEERS
​
Are you interested in enhancing your smile? Veeners are an excellent option and are one the least invasive ways to dramatically change your smile and provide long lasting results. Veneers are a thin, customized layer of porcelain that are bonded over your front teeth to create an extremely natural and aesthetic smile. Together, you and your dentist will design a smile with beautiful teeth that complements your face shape and size. Ask us how we can help you achieve the smile you always wanted.
WHITENING
​
Many people associate professional teeth whitening with movie stars and brides. But in fact, it is an extremely popular procedure in cosmetic dentistry. And at BayWell Dental Centre, we offer the most current teeth whitening services to achieve immediate results in just one hour of chair time.
WISDOM TEETH EXTRACTION
​
The extraction of wisdom teeth is necessary when they are prevented from properly erupting into the mouth. They may grow sideways, partially emerge in the mouth, and even remain trapped beneath the gum within the jaw. These impacted teeth can eventually cause severe infections, cavities and shift other teeth. The most serious complications occur when tumors or cysts form around the impacted wisdom teeth, resulting in the destruction of the jawbone and healthy adjacent teeth. The early removal of the third molar tooth usually avoids these problems and decreases surgical risks involved with the procedure. This can be done at our office with or without sedation depending on patient specific need and preference.
DIGITAL X-RAYS
​
Our digital x-rays reduce exposure by over 85% and is eco-friendly through reducing the use of chemicals to process film the traditional way. Digital x-rays are viewed instantly on the computer monitor in each operatory in our office. This improves the way we diagnose disease and allows us to better communicate with you to make treatment decisions together.
COSMETIC DENTISTRY
​
Years ago, aesthetic improvements in dentistry often meant multiple appointments and invasive procedures. But thanks to advances in cosmetic dentistry, dental professionals these days are able to help patients achieve spectacular results in a far less painful and time-consuming fashion.
BONDING AND WHITE FILLINGS
​
Many of us have gaps between the teeth. This may be a concern in the front teeth particularly. To close these gaps several options may be chosen. At times a porcelain veneer or laminate may be recommended to close the gaps. At other times bonding, or a white filling material, may be recommended to do the same.
BRIDGES
​
A bridge can be an excellent way to replace a missing tooth. The replacement tooth is permanent fixed to the neighbouring teeth and "bridged" together to close the space. This prevents drifting and movement of your natural teeth. A dental bridge can also be a great alternative for patients who are not candidates for implants, due to insufficient bone quantity or quality. Bridges can be made of a variety of materials, including porcelain and alloys, depending on your needs and preferences.
CROWNS
​
Dental crowns may be recommended by your dentist to restore fractured, chipped, or worn down teeth. They may also be necessary to prevent weak teeth from splitting/fracturing, especially ones that have received root canal treatment. There are many different options for modern crowns that can look extremely natural and beautiful, ranging from traditional porcelain & metal crowns, to All Ceramic Porcelain and Zirconia crowns. Ask us about CEREC Crowns and same day service!
ROOT CANAL TREATMENT
​
Root canal treatment may be recommended by your dentist to save your tooth from an infected, or dying nerve. This may sound scary to some people, but at our office, we make sure that you are completely numb, or frozen before we proceed with any treatment. This results in a painless procedure to remove the infection and save you from losing your tooth. Your dentist may recommend a crown after a root canal procedure to preserve the integrity of the tooth for long term success.
GUM GRAFTS
​
Gum grafting is a procedure to develop gum tissue where absent due to excessive gum recession from abrasive brushing techniques or gum disease. Receding gums can cause inflammation, tooth sensitivity and an uneven smile line. Your dentist can use a gum graft to cover the exposed root. This can be done for one tooth or several teeth to even your gum line and reduce sensitivity.
TEETH STRAIGHTENING
​
If you want to improve your smile and want healthy, straight, teeth - ask us if you are candidate for orthodontic treatment with Suresmile Clear aligners. Designed for the modern patient, these aligners will help you achieve your ideal smile fast, effectively and more discrete than ever. We will work with you to create a customized plan, and depending on the scope, treatment may take only 6-8 months.

THERAPEUTIC BOTOX AND TMD
What’s involved in Therapeutic Botox® TMJ treatment?

Botox® can be injected into the temporalis and masseter muscles and works by blocking nerve signals that cause uncontrollable muscle movements, eventually relaxing the muscles. You can expect results 2-3 weeks from the time of treatment and it can remain effective for anywhere between two and six months depending on the patient. After several treatments, patients report a decreased need for touch ups and this will depend on the severity of your condition as well as metabolism.

Benefits and Risks of Therapeutic Botox® treatment

Therapeutic Botox® injections can often provide substantial relief to those suffering from soreness and pain of the TMJ while reducing the ability of muscles to engage in problematic grinding, which can also slow down worn down teeth. The potential side effects of Therapeutic Botox® treatment are mild, and usually go away within a few hours or days after treatment. Potential side effects include: inflammation, bleeding, bruising, swelling, muscle weakness, pain at injection site and allergic reactions.

Is it covered by my insurance?

Many insurances do cover Therapeutic Botox in the treatment of TMD. Our staff are experienced with submitting estimates and can do so on your behalf to assist you, just ask us!
WISDOM TOOTH REMOVAL
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUTWISDOM TEETH
A Wisdom Tooth Extraction is a routine surgical procedure to remove one or more wisdom teeth — the four permanent adult teeth that are the last to erupt at the back of your mouth. If a wisdom tooth does not have room to grow, it is considered an “impacted wisdom tooth,” and this can result in pain, infection, or another dental problem. They present between the ages of 17 – 25, and often cause discomfort due to lack of room in the jaw or angle of entry.
We use X-rays to carefully assess the problem and, if necessary, plan for extraction. Wisdom teeth are usually easier to remove at a younger (17-25) age because there is a greater probability that the roots have not fully developed and the bone surrounding the teeth is typically less dense.
​
Problems with Impacted Wisdom Teeth Include:
Pain

Is Wisdom Teeth Removal Really Necessary?
It depends. We evaluate every patient on an individual basis to determine how the presence of your wisdom teeth are affecting your oral health. If you have wisdom teeth that are causing dental problems, our team will discuss the benefits of removing them.If you have impacted wisdom teeth that are not causing dental problems (asymptomatic), we will discuss the pros and cons of preventive extraction. In either case, the decision is ultimately up to the patient.
​
Can’t I just wait until my wisdom teeth hurt?
You can, but there are important benefits to removing your wisdom teeth while you are in the ideal age range(17-25) that you should be aware of:
Younger adults usually do not have fully formed wisdom teeth, which makes them easier to remove
Younger adults usually do not have fully formed wisdom teeth, which makes them easier to remove
Younger adults tend to heal and recover quickly

Older adults may experience more difficulty with surgery and complications after surgery.

What are the risks of the procedure?
Most procedures are routine and serious complications are not expected. Any problems that do happen are usually minor and can be treated. Complications can include:
Pain, swelling, limited mouth opening, bleeding - these are all normal and improves after the first few days

Sedation Options to Address Dental Anxiety
A wisdom tooth extraction can be a stressful experience for many patients. We offer minimal conscious sedation and oral moderate sedation to relieve anxiety and improve patient experience.
Minimal sedation (Laughing Gas): Depending on the dose administered, this is a relaxed state where patients can walk, talk, and breathe normally. Patients are not asleep.
Minimal sedation (Laughing Gas): Depending on the dose administered, this is a relaxed state where patients can walk, talk, and breathe normally. Patients are not asleep.
Moderate sedation (Twilight Sedation): This is a modestly deeper sedation. Patients will be able to talk and respond to questions but will feel more drowsy. Depending on the medications used, a patient may or may not remember the procedure.
Moderate sedation (Twilight Sedation): This is a modestly deeper sedation. Patients will be able to talk and respond to questions but will feel more drowsy. Depending on the medications used, a patient may or may not remember the procedure.

We use sedation for various surgical procedures and provide instructions for eating and drinking before and after treatment. Following your appointment, patients will need to return home accompanied by a responsible adult. To ensure complete safety, you will be monitored throughout the entire procedure by our team.
​
Wisdom Tooth Surgery Healing Time
The healing process after wisdom tooth removal surgery can vary from 7 to 10 days. Depending on the circumstances, brushing, eating, and other actions can be resumed the next day. A follow-up visit is scheduled with your dentist to assess and assist as needed with your recovery and address any post surgical concerns.As you heal from your surgery, we recommend that you follow your dentist’s instructions on:
Bleeding. Some oozing of blood may occur the first day after wisdom tooth removal. Try to avoid excessive spitting so that you do not dislodge the blood clot from the socket. Replace gauze over the extraction site as directed by your dentist or oral surgeon.

Pain management. You may be able to manage pain with an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), or a prescription pain medication from your dentist. Prescription pain medication may be especially helpful if bone has been removed during the procedure. Holding a cold pack against your jaw also may relieve pain.

Cleaning your mouth. Do not brush your teeth, rinse your mouth, spit or use mouthwash during the first 24 hours after surgery. You may be told to resume brushing your teeth after the first 24 hours. Be particularly gentle near the surgical wound when brushing and gently rinse your mouth with warm salt water every two hours and after meals for a week.

Having a cerec crown is beneficial for a number of reasons. In the hands of a skilled dentist, it is extremely accurate. We have found that a CEREC crown requires little to no adjustment prior to fitting in the mouth. Second, because it is a digital scan, it means that a CEREC crown does not require impression materials or trays - that means no goop in your mouth! Third, with a many different choices in materials and colour, we will select a tooth colour that mimics your tooth and looks natural. They are bonded to your tooth are made of the strongest dental materials available and will last you many years to come. Finally, CEREC crowns are CONVENIENT for you, the patient. Because a CEREC crown can be done in one appointment, you do not need to take time off work or school for a second insertion appointment - your crown will be inserted on the same day.

Why should patients choose you as their provider instead of others in the area?
The average dentist spends less than 1000$ in continuing education a year. In contrast, Dr. Luong invests over $10,000 per year in CE for herself and the entire team in order to offer the absolute highest quality of dentistry to our patients. Choose our clinic if you desire honest, compassionate and meticulous dental care. This is our passion, and we love what we do. Our patients know this the moment they walk through the door.
What are the top 3 treatments that you focus on?
​
We deliver excellent care in all areas of general dentistry. Our hygienists are distinguished by their excellent, thorough and gentle hygiene care, whether you attend regularly or it has been a while. Our dentists are skilled in many different areas, such as aesthetic bonding, perfect fitting single visit dental crowns, 3D guided dental implants, gum grafts, wisdom teeth and planning/phasing more complex treatment such as mouth rehabilitation. Each of our dentists have a specialized niche, and our admin team will help connect you with the right provider.
​
What are you proud of in your practice?
At Baywell Dental, we are proud to treat our patients with kindness and respect, and to provide you with an exceptional dental experience!

DENTAL SERVICES
GENERAL DENTISTRY
​
If you're looking for a dental office that employs friendly and helpful staff, BayWell Dental is a practice worth visiting. Our dentists were trained at the University of Toronto and are dedicated to staying current with new advancements and techniques to benefit your teeth and enhance your smile. Our practice was established in 1973, and ever since we've been committed to providing exceptional dental care.
EMERGENCY DENTISTRY
​
Dental problems don't always happen during regularly scheduled office hours. This can be disruptive and can range from a minor inconvenience to severe pain. It may happen in the form of a chipped tooth, broken filling, oral trauma, infection and possibly swelling. Here at BayWell Dental, we offer flexible morning and evening hours, including Saturdays to accommodate your emergency needs.
DENTAL CLEANINGS & PREVENTIVE CARE
​
Regular dental checkups and cleanings are essential to maintaining your oral health. During your cleaning appointment, your hygienist and dentist will inspect for signs of tooth decay, gum disease, gum recession and tooth wear. They will do an preliminary oral cancer screen and assess other problems that you may not even be aware of. This is all in addition to providing a thorough cleaning and polish. Our goal is to help you maintain a healthy smile by designing a periodontal program to suit your needs. If its been more than 6 months, call us to book a cleaning and check up today!
IMPLANTS
​
Dental implants have revolutionized the way we restore missing teeth. A dental implant is a bone friendly titanium post that is placed into the missing tooth socket. The implant then integrates permanently with your own jaw bone. After a few months, you are then able to receive a crown placed directly onto your implant. Implants are an excellent way to restore missing teeth with a natural and aesthetic result.
VENEERS
​
Are you interested in enhancing your smile? Veeners are an excellent option and are one the least invasive ways to dramatically change your smile and provide long lasting results. Veneers are a thin, customized layer of porcelain that are bonded over your front teeth to create an extremely natural and aesthetic smile. Together, you and your dentist will design a smile with beautiful teeth that complements your face shape and size. Ask us how we can help you achieve the smile you always wanted.
WHITENING
​
Many people associate professional teeth whitening with movie stars and brides. But in fact, it is an extremely popular procedure in cosmetic dentistry. And at BayWell Dental Centre, we offer the most current teeth whitening services to achieve immediate results in just one hour of chair time.
WISDOM TEETH EXTRACTION
​
The extraction of wisdom teeth is necessary when they are prevented from properly erupting into the mouth. They may grow sideways, partially emerge in the mouth, and even remain trapped beneath the gum within the jaw. These impacted teeth can eventually cause severe infections, cavities and shift other teeth. The most serious complications occur when tumors or cysts form around the impacted wisdom teeth, resulting in the destruction of the jawbone and healthy adjacent teeth. The early removal of the third molar tooth usually avoids these problems and decreases surgical risks involved with the procedure. This can be done at our office with or without sedation depending on patient specific need and preference.
DIGITAL X-RAYS
​
Our digital x-rays reduce exposure by over 85% and is eco-friendly through reducing the use of chemicals to process film the traditional way. Digital x-rays are viewed instantly on the computer monitor in each operatory in our office. This improves the way we diagnose disease and allows us to better communicate with you to make treatment decisions together.
COSMETIC DENTISTRY
​
Years ago, aesthetic improvements in dentistry often meant multiple appointments and invasive procedures. But thanks to advances in cosmetic dentistry, dental professionals these days are able to help patients achieve spectacular results in a far less painful and time-consuming fashion.
BONDING AND WHITE FILLINGS
​
Many of us have gaps between the teeth. This may be a concern in the front teeth particularly. To close these gaps several options may be chosen. At times a porcelain veneer or laminate may be recommended to close the gaps. At other times bonding, or a white filling material, may be recommended to do the same.
BRIDGES
​
A bridge can be an excellent way to replace a missing tooth. The replacement tooth is permanent fixed to the neighbouring teeth and "bridged" together to close the space. This prevents drifting and movement of your natural teeth. A dental bridge can also be a great alternative for patients who are not candidates for implants, due to insufficient bone quantity or quality. Bridges can be made of a variety of materials, including porcelain and alloys, depending on your needs and preferences.
CROWNS
​
Dental crowns may be recommended by your dentist to restore fractured, chipped, or worn down teeth. They may also be necessary to prevent weak teeth from splitting/fracturing, especially ones that have received root canal treatment. There are many different options for modern crowns that can look extremely natural and beautiful, ranging from traditional porcelain & metal crowns, to All Ceramic Porcelain and Zirconia crowns. Ask us about CEREC Crowns and same day service!
ROOT CANAL TREATMENT
​
Root canal treatment may be recommended by your dentist to save your tooth from an infected, or dying nerve. This may sound scary to some people, but at our office, we make sure that you are completely numb, or frozen before we proceed with any treatment. This results in a painless procedure to remove the infection and save you from losing your tooth. Your dentist may recommend a crown after a root canal procedure to preserve the integrity of the tooth for long term success.
GUM GRAFTS
​
Gum grafting is a procedure to develop gum tissue where absent due to excessive gum recession from abrasive brushing techniques or gum disease. Receding gums can cause inflammation, tooth sensitivity and an uneven smile line. Your dentist can use a gum graft to cover the exposed root. This can be done for one tooth or several teeth to even your gum line and reduce sensitivity.
TEETH STRAIGHTENING
​
If you want to improve your smile and want healthy, straight, teeth - ask us if you are candidate for orthodontic treatment with Suresmile Clear aligners. Designed for the modern patient, these aligners will help you achieve your ideal smile fast, effectively and more discrete than ever. We will work with you to create a customized plan, and depending on the scope, treatment may take only 6-8 months.
THE STUDENT DISCOUNT DENTAL NETWORK
At Baywell Dental Centre, we are proud to be apart of the Greenshield Student Discount Network Program. If you are a student participating in a university or college dental plan, such as University of Toronto, George Brown, Ryerson, York, or OCAD, you are eligible to receive preventive care at a reduce fee. Some procedures require a co-payment if they are partially subsidized. For other dental services, there may be a co-payment if they are partially subsidized. Call us at (416) 961-6630 to find out more!
THERAPEUTIC BOTOX AND TMD
What’s involved in Therapeutic Botox® TMJ treatment?

Botox® can be injected into the temporalis and masseter muscles and works by blocking nerve signals that cause uncontrollable muscle movements, eventually relaxing the muscles. You can expect results 2-3 weeks from the time of treatment and it can remain effective for anywhere between two and six months depending on the patient. After several treatments, patients report a decreased need for touch ups and this will depend on the severity of your condition as well as metabolism.

Benefits and Risks of Therapeutic Botox® treatment

Therapeutic Botox® injections can often provide substantial relief to those suffering from soreness and pain of the TMJ while reducing the ability of muscles to engage in problematic grinding, which can also slow down worn down teeth. The potential side effects of Therapeutic Botox® treatment are mild, and usually go away within a few hours or days after treatment. Potential side effects include: inflammation, bleeding, bruising, swelling, muscle weakness, pain at injection site and allergic reactions.

Is it covered by my insurance?

Many insurances do cover Therapeutic Botox in the treatment of TMD. Our staff are experienced with submitting estimates and can do so on your behalf to assist you, just ask us!
WISDOM TOOTH REMOVAL
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUTWISDOM TEETH
A Wisdom Tooth Extraction is a routine surgical procedure to remove one or more wisdom teeth — the four permanent adult teeth that are the last to erupt at the back of your mouth. If a wisdom tooth does not have room to grow, it is considered an “impacted wisdom tooth,” and this can result in pain, infection, or another dental problem. They present between the ages of 17 – 25, and often cause discomfort due to lack of room in the jaw or angle of entry.
We use X-rays to carefully assess the problem and, if necessary, plan for extraction. Wisdom teeth are usually easier to remove at a younger (17-25) age because there is a greater probability that the roots have not fully developed and the bone surrounding the teeth is typically less dense.
​
Problems with Impacted Wisdom Teeth Include:
Pain

Is Wisdom Teeth Removal Really Necessary?
It depends. We evaluate every patient on an individual basis to determine how the presence of your wisdom teeth are affecting your oral health. If you have wisdom teeth that are causing dental problems, our team will discuss the benefits of removing them.If you have impacted wisdom teeth that are not causing dental problems (asymptomatic), we will discuss the pros and cons of preventive extraction. In either case, the decision is ultimately up to the patient.
​
Can’t I just wait until my wisdom teeth hurt?
You can, but there are important benefits to removing your wisdom teeth while you are in the ideal age range(17-25) that you should be aware of:
Younger adults usually do not have fully formed wisdom teeth, which makes them easier to remove
Younger adults usually do not have fully formed wisdom teeth, which makes them easier to remove
Younger adults tend to heal and recover quickly

Older adults may experience more difficulty with surgery and complications after surgery.
Older adults may experience more difficulty with surgery and complications after surgery.

What are the risks of the procedure?
Most procedures are routine and serious complications are not expected. Any problems that do happen are usually minor and can be treated. Complications can include:
Pain, swelling, limited mouth opening, bleeding - these are all normal and improves after the first few days

Sedation Options to Address Dental Anxiety
A wisdom tooth extraction can be a stressful experience for many patients. We offer minimal conscious sedation and oral moderate sedation to relieve anxiety and improve patient experience.
Minimal sedation (Laughing Gas): Depending on the dose administered, this is a relaxed state where patients can walk, talk, and breathe normally. Patients are not asleep.
Minimal sedation (Laughing Gas): Depending on the dose administered, this is a relaxed state where patients can walk, talk, and breathe normally. Patients are not asleep.
Moderate sedation (Twilight Sedation): This is a modestly deeper sedation. Patients will be able to talk and respond to questions but will feel more drowsy. Depending on the medications used, a patient may or may not remember the procedure.

We use sedation for various surgical procedures and provide instructions for eating and drinking before and after treatment. Following your appointment, patients will need to return home accompanied by a responsible adult. To ensure complete safety, you will be monitored throughout the entire procedure by our team.
​
Wisdom Tooth Surgery Healing Time
The healing process after wisdom tooth removal surgery can vary from 7 to 10 days. Depending on the circumstances, brushing, eating, and other actions can be resumed the next day. A follow-up visit is scheduled with your dentist to assess and assist as needed with your recovery and address any post surgical concerns.As you heal from your surgery, we recommend that you follow your dentist’s instructions on:
Bleeding. Some oozing of blood may occur the first day after wisdom tooth removal. Try to avoid excessive spitting so that you do not dislodge the blood clot from the socket. Replace gauze over the extraction site as directed by your dentist or oral surgeon.

Pain management. You may be able to manage pain with an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), or a prescription pain medication from your dentist. Prescription pain medication may be especially helpful if bone has been removed during the procedure. Holding a cold pack against your jaw also may relieve pain.

Cleaning your mouth. Do not brush your teeth, rinse your mouth, spit or use mouthwash during the first 24 hours after surgery. You may be told to resume brushing your teeth after the first 24 hours. Be particularly gentle near the surgical wound when brushing and gently rinse your mouth with warm salt water every two hours and after meals for a week.

Having a cerec crown is beneficial for a number of reasons. In the hands of a skilled dentist, it is extremely accurate. We have found that a CEREC crown requires little to no adjustment prior to fitting in the mouth. Second, because it is a digital scan, it means that a CEREC crown does not require impression materials or trays - that means no goop in your mouth! Third, with a many different choices in materials and colour, we will select a tooth colour that mimics your tooth and looks natural. They are bonded to your tooth are made of the strongest dental materials available and will last you many years to come. Finally, CEREC crowns are CONVENIENT for you, the patient. Because a CEREC crown can be done in one appointment, you do not need to take time off work or school for a second insertion appointment - your crown will be inserted on the same day.
Dr. Luong will recommend a CEREC crown if she believes it is the right treatment for you. Feel free to check out the videos below. They show the CEREC process from start to finish.

​
Why should patients choose you as their provider instead of others in the area?
The average dentist spends less than 1000$ in continuing education a year. In contrast, Dr. Luong invests over $10,000 per year in CE for herself and the entire team in order to offer the absolute highest quality of dentistry to our patients. Choose our clinic if you desire honest, compassionate and meticulous dental care. This is our passion, and we love what we do. Our patients know this the moment they walk through the door.
What are the top 3 treatments that you focus on?
​
We deliver excellent care in all areas of general dentistry. Our hygienists are distinguished by their excellent, thorough and gentle hygiene care, whether you attend regularly or it has been a while. Our dentists are skilled in many different areas, such as aesthetic bonding, perfect fitting single visit dental crowns, 3D guided dental implants, gum grafts, wisdom teeth and planning/phasing more complex treatment such as mouth rehabilitation. Each of our dentists have a specialized niche, and our admin team will help connect you with the right provider.
​
What are you proud of in your practice?
At Baywell Dental, we are proud to treat our patients with kindness and respect, and to provide you with an exceptional dental experience! We are proud to keep abreast of new materials and techniques that are more effective and longer lasting in order to provide our patients with the highest level of care.  We have invested in the very best of technology to benefit our patients.

WHAT PEOPLE SAY
The team at Baywell Dental is the best dental team I have ever had the privilege of being cared for by! Lisa (reception) is friendly, understanding, and super accommodating with busy schedules. She manages to make every booking experience so easy in spite of any limitations I may have time-wise. I had my wisdom teeth extracted with Dr Song who did a superb job - barely any swelling a few hours out of the surgery and awesome follow-up care. Hai Shi (my hygienist) is extremely professional, thorough, and such a kind soul. Dr Luong is simply superb and makes dental visits so comfortable. I highly recommend this wonderful office!!!

WHAT PEOPLE SAY
The team at Baywell Dental is the best dental team I have ever had the privilege of being cared for by! Lisa (reception) is friendly, understanding, and super accommodating with busy schedules. She manages to make every booking experience so easy in spite of any limitations I may have time-wise. I had my wisdom teeth extracted with Dr Song who did a superb job - barely any swelling a few hours out of the surgery and awesome follow-up care. Hai Shi (my hygienist) is extremely professional, thorough, and such a kind soul. Dr Luong is simply superb and makes dental visits so comfortable. I highly recommend this wonderful office!!!

WHAT PEOPLE SAY
The team at Baywell Dental is the best dental team I have ever had the privilege of being cared for by! Lisa (reception) is friendly, understanding, and super accommodating with busy schedules. She manages to make every booking experience so easy in spite of any limitations I may have time-wise. I had my wisdom teeth extracted with Dr Song who did a superb job - barely any swelling a few hours out of the surgery and awesome follow-up care. Hai Shi (my hygienist) is extremely professional, thorough, and such a kind soul. Dr Luong is simply superb and makes dental visits so comfortable. I highly recommend this wonderful office!!!

Patients often think orthodontic treatment is only for children but that is just not true! Modern technology using Clear aligners is gaining popularity because it is discrete, fast, and effective. It is perfect for the adult patient who wants straight healthy teeth and designed to fit your lifestyle. If you want healthy teeth that will last you a lifetime, consider a conversation with our dentists to see how SureSmile Aligners can help you achieve that. It is the ultimate preventive treatment and can save you time, money and unwanted visits to the dentist in the future.
How SureSmile clear aligner therapy works
In order to know where your teeth need to go, your dentist will spend time thoughtfully designing a Digital Diagnostic Tooth Setup encompassing the principles of an ideal bite (occlusion), gum health, skeletal proportions and space restrictions. We then order a series of custom-fabricated aligners designed apply a light pressure on your teeth and promotes tooth movement into their ideal position gradually. You will wear your aligners for 20 to 22 hours per day and switch them out for the next tray approximately every two weeks.
SureSmile Aligners are loved by patients and dentists alike because it is:
Effective: because the aligners are fabricated based on advanced computer technology, the aligners create precise movements while requiring fewer adjustments than traditional braces

Versatile: SureSmile is a great option for a wide variety of misalignment issues ranging from crowding, overbite, deep bites, spacing and more.It can also be used to move teeth into ideal positions prior to major restorative work like crowns or veneers in order to minimize tooth reduction (this requires a more complex explanation….ask Dr. Luong for more details).

How do I get started?
The first step towards getting the straight, healthy smile you’ve always wanted is to schedule your initial consultation. During your consultation, we will talk with you about your goals for your smile, evaluate your bite and tooth alignment, and establish if you are a good candidate for treatment in our care. We will have a conversation about the pros and cons of treatment, and any limitations that exist for your case. Once the decision is made to move forward, we take a digital scan of your mouth so that we can begin planning your treatment.

DENTAL SERVICES
GENERAL DENTISTRY
​
If you're looking for a dental office that employs friendly and helpful staff, BayWell Dental is a practice worth visiting. Our dentists were trained at the University of Toronto and are dedicated to staying current with new advancements and techniques to benefit your teeth and enhance your smile. Our practice was established in 1973, and ever since we've been committed to providing exceptional dental care.
EMERGENCY DENTISTRY
​
Dental problems don't always happen during regularly scheduled office hours. This can be disruptive and can range from a minor inconvenience to severe pain. It may happen in the form of a chipped tooth, broken filling, oral trauma, infection and possibly swelling. Here at BayWell Dental, we offer flexible morning and evening hours, including Saturdays to accommodate your emergency needs.
DENTAL CLEANINGS & PREVENTIVE CARE
​
Regular dental checkups and cleanings are essential to maintaining your oral health. During your cleaning appointment, your hygienist and dentist will inspect for signs of tooth decay, gum disease, gum recession and tooth wear. They will do an preliminary oral cancer screen and assess other problems that you may not even be aware of. This is all in addition to providing a thorough cleaning and polish. Our goal is to help you maintain a healthy smile by designing a periodontal program to suit your needs. If its been more than 6 months, call us to book a cleaning and check up today!
IMPLANTS
​
Dental implants have revolutionized the way we restore missing teeth. A dental implant is a bone friendly titanium post that is placed into the missing tooth socket. The implant then integrates permanently with your own jaw bone. After a few months, you are then able to receive a crown placed directly onto your implant. Implants are an excellent way to restore missing teeth with a natural and aesthetic result.
VENEERS
​
Are you interested in enhancing your smile? Veeners are an excellent option and are one the least invasive ways to dramatically change your smile and provide long lasting results. Veneers are a thin, customized layer of porcelain that are bonded over your front teeth to create an extremely natural and aesthetic smile. Together, you and your dentist will design a smile with beautiful teeth that complements your face shape and size. Ask us how we can help you achieve the smile you always wanted.
WHITENING
​
Many people associate professional teeth whitening with movie stars and brides. But in fact, it is an extremely popular procedure in cosmetic dentistry. And at BayWell Dental Centre, we offer the most current teeth whitening services to achieve immediate results in just one hour of chair time.
WISDOM TEETH EXTRACTION
​
The extraction of wisdom teeth is necessary when they are prevented from properly erupting into the mouth. They may grow sideways, partially emerge in the mouth, and even remain trapped beneath the gum within the jaw. These impacted teeth can eventually cause severe infections, cavities and shift other teeth. The most serious complications occur when tumors or cysts form around the impacted wisdom teeth, resulting in the destruction of the jawbone and healthy adjacent teeth. The early removal of the third molar tooth usually avoids these problems and decreases surgical risks involved with the procedure. This can be done at our office with or without sedation depending on patient specific need and preference.
DIGITAL X-RAYS
​
Our digital x-rays reduce exposure by over 85% and is eco-friendly through reducing the use of chemicals to process film the traditional way. Digital x-rays are viewed instantly on the computer monitor in each operatory in our office. This improves the way we diagnose disease and allows us to better communicate with you to make treatment decisions together.
COSMETIC DENTISTRY
​
Years ago, aesthetic improvements in dentistry often meant multiple appointments and invasive procedures. But thanks to advances in cosmetic dentistry, dental professionals these days are able to help patients achieve spectacular results in a far less painful and time-consuming fashion.
BONDING AND WHITE FILLINGS
​
Many of us have gaps between the teeth. This may be a concern in the front teeth particularly. To close these gaps several options may be chosen. At times a porcelain veneer or laminate may be recommended to close the gaps. At other times bonding, or a white filling material, may be recommended to do the same.
BRIDGES
​
A bridge can be an excellent way to replace a missing tooth. The replacement tooth is permanent fixed to the neighbouring teeth and "bridged" together to close the space. This prevents drifting and movement of your natural teeth. A dental bridge can also be a great alternative for patients who are not candidates for implants, due to insufficient bone quantity or quality. Bridges can be made of a variety of materials, including porcelain and alloys, depending on your needs and preferences.
CROWNS
​
Dental crowns may be recommended by your dentist to restore fractured, chipped, or worn down teeth. They may also be necessary to prevent weak teeth from splitting/fracturing, especially ones that have received root canal treatment. There are many different options for modern crowns that can look extremely natural and beautiful, ranging from traditional porcelain & metal crowns, to All Ceramic Porcelain and Zirconia crowns. Ask us about CEREC Crowns and same day service!
ROOT CANAL TREATMENT
​
Root canal treatment may be recommended by your dentist to save your tooth from an infected, or dying nerve. This may sound scary to some people, but at our office, we make sure that you are completely numb, or frozen before we proceed with any treatment. This results in a painless procedure to remove the infection and save you from losing your tooth. Your dentist may recommend a crown after a root canal procedure to preserve the integrity of the tooth for long term success.
GUM GRAFTS
​
Gum grafting is a procedure to develop gum tissue where absent due to excessive gum recession from abrasive brushing techniques or gum disease. Receding gums can cause inflammation, tooth sensitivity and an uneven smile line. Your dentist can use a gum graft to cover the exposed root. This can be done for one tooth or several teeth to even your gum line and reduce sensitivity.
TEETH STRAIGHTENING
​
If you want to improve your smile and want healthy, straight, teeth - ask us if you are candidate for orthodontic treatment with Suresmile Clear aligners. Designed for the modern patient, these aligners will help you achieve your ideal smile fast, effectively and more discrete than ever. We will work with you to create a customized plan, and depending on the scope, treatment may take only 6-8 months.
THE STUDENT DISCOUNT DENTAL NETWORK
At Baywell Dental Centre, we are proud to be apart of the Greenshield Student Discount Network Program. If you are a student participating in a university or college dental plan, such as University of Toronto, George Brown, Ryerson, York, or OCAD, you are eligible to receive preventive care at a reduce fee. Some procedures require a co-payment if they are partially subsidized. For other dental services, there may be a co-payment if they are partially subsidized. Call us at (416) 961-6630 to find out more!
THERAPEUTIC BOTOX AND TMD
What’s involved in Therapeutic Botox® TMJ treatment?

Botox® can be injected into the temporalis and masseter muscles and works by blocking nerve signals that cause uncontrollable muscle movements, eventually relaxing the muscles. You can expect results 2-3 weeks from the time of treatment and it can remain effective for anywhere between two and six months depending on the patient. After several treatments, patients report a decreased need for touch ups and this will depend on the severity of your condition as well as metabolism.

Benefits and Risks of Therapeutic Botox® treatment

Therapeutic Botox® injections can often provide substantial relief to those suffering from soreness and pain of the TMJ while reducing the ability of muscles to engage in problematic grinding, which can also slow down worn down teeth. The potential side effects of Therapeutic Botox® treatment are mild, and usually go away within a few hours or days after treatment. Potential side effects include: inflammation, bleeding, bruising, swelling, muscle weakness, pain at injection site and allergic reactions.

Is it covered by my insurance?

Many insurances do cover Therapeutic Botox in the treatment of TMD. Our staff are experienced with submitting estimates and can do so on your behalf to assist you, just ask us!
WISDOM TOOTH REMOVAL
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUTWISDOM TEETH
A Wisdom Tooth Extraction is a routine surgical procedure to remove one or more wisdom teeth — the four permanent adult teeth that are the last to erupt at the back of your mouth. If a wisdom tooth does not have room to grow, it is considered an “impacted wisdom tooth,” and this can result in pain, infection, or another dental problem. They present between the ages of 17 – 25, and often cause discomfort due to lack of room in the jaw or angle of entry.
We use X-rays to carefully assess the problem and, if necessary, plan for extraction. Wisdom teeth are usually easier to remove at a younger (17-25) age because there is a greater probability that the roots have not fully developed and the bone surrounding the teeth is typically less dense.
​
Problems with Impacted Wisdom Teeth Include:
Pain

Is Wisdom Teeth Removal Really Necessary?
It depends. We evaluate every patient on an individual basis to determine how the presence of your wisdom teeth are affecting your oral health. If you have wisdom teeth that are causing dental problems, our team will discuss the benefits of removing them.If you have impacted wisdom teeth that are not causing dental problems (asymptomatic), we will discuss the pros and cons of preventive extraction. In either case, the decision is ultimately up to the patient.
​
Can’t I just wait until my wisdom teeth hurt?
You can, but there are important benefits to removing your wisdom teeth while you are in the ideal age range(17-25) that you should be aware of:
Younger adults usually do not have fully formed wisdom teeth, which makes them easier to remove

Younger adults tend to heal and recover quickly

Older adults may experience more difficulty with surgery and complications after surgery.
Older adults may experience more difficulty with surgery and complications after surgery.

What are the risks of the procedure?
Most procedures are routine and serious complications are not expected. Any problems that do happen are usually minor and can be treated. Complications can include:
Pain, swelling, limited mouth opening, bleeding - these are all normal and improves after the first few days

Sedation Options to Address Dental Anxiety
A wisdom tooth extraction can be a stressful experience for many patients. We offer minimal conscious sedation and oral moderate sedation to relieve anxiety and improve patient experience.
Minimal sedation (Laughing Gas): Depending on the dose administered, this is a relaxed state where patients can walk, talk, and breathe normally. Patients are not asleep.
Minimal sedation (Laughing Gas): Depending on the dose administered, this is a relaxed state where patients can walk, talk, and breathe normally. Patients are not asleep.
Moderate sedation (Twilight Sedation): This is a modestly deeper sedation. Patients will be able to talk and respond to questions but will feel more drowsy. Depending on the medications used, a patient may or may not remember the procedure.
Moderate sedation (Twilight Sedation): This is a modestly deeper sedation. Patients will be able to talk and respond to questions but will feel more drowsy. Depending on the medications used, a patient may or may not remember the procedure.

We use sedation for various surgical procedures and provide instructions for eating and drinking before and after treatment. Following your appointment, patients will need to return home accompanied by a responsible adult. To ensure complete safety, you will be monitored throughout the entire procedure by our team.
​
Wisdom Tooth Surgery Healing Time
The healing process after wisdom tooth removal surgery can vary from 7 to 10 days. Depending on the circumstances, brushing, eating, and other actions can be resumed the next day. A follow-up visit is scheduled with your dentist to assess and assist as needed with your recovery and address any post surgical concerns.As you heal from your surgery, we recommend that you follow your dentist’s instructions on:
Bleeding. Some oozing of blood may occur the first day after wisdom tooth removal. Try to avoid excessive spitting so that you do not dislodge the blood clot from the socket. Replace gauze over the extraction site as directed by your dentist or oral surgeon.

Pain management. You may be able to manage pain with an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), or a prescription pain medication from your dentist. Prescription pain medication may be especially helpful if bone has been removed during the procedure. Holding a cold pack against your jaw also may relieve pain.

Cleaning your mouth. Do not brush your teeth, rinse your mouth, spit or use mouthwash during the first 24 hours after surgery. You may be told to resume brushing your teeth after the first 24 hours. Be particularly gentle near the surgical wound when brushing and gently rinse your mouth with warm salt water every two hours and after meals for a week.

Having a cerec crown is beneficial for a number of reasons. In the hands of a skilled dentist, it is extremely accurate. We have found that a CEREC crown requires little to no adjustment prior to fitting in the mouth. Second, because it is a digital scan, it means that a CEREC crown does not require impression materials or trays - that means no goop in your mouth! Third, with a many different choices in materials and colour, we will select a tooth colour that mimics your tooth and looks natural. They are bonded to your tooth are made of the strongest dental materials available and will last you many years to come. Finally, CEREC crowns are CONVENIENT for you, the patient. Because a CEREC crown can be done in one appointment, you do not need to take time off work or school for a second insertion appointment - your crown will be inserted on the same day.
Dr. Luong will recommend a CEREC crown if she believes it is the right treatment for you. Feel free to check out the videos below. They show the CEREC process from start to finish.

What Should I Look For When Choosing A Dentist?
A good dentist in Toronto should be well-established, knowledgeable and caring. They should demonstrate experience in general and cosmetic dentistry, and offer a wide range of services that meet your particular needs. It's important that you feel comfortable with your dentist, so look for someone who is communicative and puts you at ease. They should also be honest in terms of pricing and keep up to date with the latest dental techniques and technologies. You should also check their credentials and reviews from previous patients. When you find the right dentist in Toronto, it will be an enjoyable and stress-free experience where you can trust your oral health is in good hands.
When Should I See A Dentist?
Going to the dentist twice a year for a checkup and cleaning can help keep your teeth healthy and strong. It's important to find a dentist you trust and feel comfortable with and schedule your checkup and cleaning every 6 months. Regular visits to the dentist will help you prevent cavities, dental decay, and other serious dental issues. If you ever feel discomfort or pain in your mouth or teeth, it's important to schedule a visit with your dentist right away. Not only will a checkup allow them to determine the cause of your pain and create a plan to fix it, but it will also help to protect your dental health over time.
What Issues Can Dentists Treat?
Dentists in Toronto are highly trained professionals who can provide comprehensive preventative and restorative dental care.

With the right care and precautions, dentists in Toronto can help patients keep their teeth and gums healthy for a lifetime.
What Happens During a Check-up?
At a dental check up, your dentist will focus on assessing the health of your teeth and gums. After a dental hygiene cleaning, your dentist will visually examine your mouth for any cavities and for any loose or broken teeth. If a cavity is detected, your dentist will clean around the cavity and fill it. Your dentist may also take X-rays to help assess any underlying problems in the teeth or jaw. After the exam, your dentist may discuss with you options for improving or sustaining your oral health, such as diet advice, toothbrush and flossing tips, and recommendations for sealants or fluoride treatments.

Tips for Good Oral Health
Taking care of our oral health is an important thing to prioritize, and keeping in mind simple practices can help us keep a healthy smile. Here are five tips for taking care of your teeth: 
            
            1. Brush your teeth for two minutes two times a day. 
            
            2. Floss once per day.
            
            3. Replace your toothbrush every three to four months, or sooner if the bristles are fraying.
            
            4. Visit your dentist for check ups and cleanings every six months.
            
            5. Be aware of foods and drinks that can cause tooth decay and limit the amount of sugary and acidic items you consume.
            
            By following these tips, you can help ensure your teeth stay healthy and strong.
Common Dental Problems
Dental problems are common and can range from cavities, to gum disease, to teeth grinding. Cavities are caused by tooth decay, when the enamel - the hard protective outer layer of the tooth - wears away and bacteria set in. Gum disease, or periodontal disease, occurs when the gums become infected and start to pull away from the teeth. Teeth grinding, also known as bruxism, is a condition where the individual can grind or clench their teeth, which can eventually lead to teeth being cracked or broken. Proper oral care and regular visits to the dentist can help prevent many of these common dental problems.

I normally have anxiety about the dentist but they explained every step to keep me comfortable. I also watched Netflix while they cleaned my teeth. Definitely my best dental experience.

APRIL L.
Kendra is the literal best! She has a way of designing the perfect project with minimal input… she just gets it!! I’ll never not use her 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
MISSY G.
I have truly enjoyed working with Kendra, she definitely helped my business grow, and she was always very professional and extremely prompt to respond to any questions I had about my social media. I will definitely be using her again on my next business venture!
HEIDI S.
I couldn't recommend anyone more highly than Kendra with KS Marketing Studio! She has done an EXCEPTIONAL job for our business from a beautiful flyer and logo to a gorgeous and professional website design. Kendra is always a pleasure to work with and she goes above and beyond her commitment and promises to deliver quality and professionalism. You don't need to look any further to find the best quality for the best price!
ANNA C.
Kendra is absolutely amazing! I have been working with her for the past 3 years, and literally from the first month I told her I thought that maybe she was an angel because of how much she has helped me! She has been helping with various aspects of my small business, including website redesign, social media, SEO, promo materials, etc. Kendra is incredibly talented and her creative skills are amazing – it just seems to come naturally to her. She is very organized and is great at keeping you updated and in the loop. She is also very patient and accessible. The thing that I love most about Kendra is that she truly wants to see you succeed and takes a genuine interest in your business. I’ve told her countless times that she always makes me feel better when I’m feeling discouraged - she is a great cheerleader! I highly recommend Kendra!
