DENTAL SERVICES
GENERAL DENTISTRY
​
If you're looking for a dental office that employs friendly and helpful staff, BayWell Dental is a practice worth visiting. Our dentists were trained at the University of Toronto and are dedicated to staying current with new advancements and techniques to benefit your teeth and enhance your smile. Our practice was established in 1973, and ever since we've been committed to providing exceptional dental care.
EMERGENCY DENTISTRY
​

Chunk 68:
EMERGENCY DENTISTRY
​
Dental problems don't always happen during regularly scheduled office hours. This can be disruptive and can range from a minor inconvenience to severe pain. It may happen in the form of a chipped tooth, broken filling, oral trauma, infection and possibly swelling. Here at BayWell Dental, we offer flexible morning and evening hours, including Saturdays to accommodate your emergency needs.
DENTAL CLEANINGS & PREVENTIVE CARE
​

Chunk 69:
Regular dental checkups and cleanings are essential to maintaining your oral health. During your cleaning appointment, your hygienist and dentist will inspect for signs of tooth decay, gum disease, gum recession and tooth wear. They will do an preliminary oral cancer screen and assess other problems that you may not even be aware of. This is all in addition to providing a thorough cleaning and polish. Our goal is to help you maintain a healthy smile by designing a periodontal program to suit

Chunk 70:
polish. Our goal is to help you maintain a healthy smile by designing a periodontal program to suit your needs. If its been more than 6 months, call us to book a cleaning and check up today!

Chunk 71:
IMPLANTS
​
Dental implants have revolutionized the way we restore missing teeth. A dental implant is a bone friendly titanium post that is placed into the missing tooth socket. The implant then integrates permanently with your own jaw bone. After a few months, you are then able to receive a crown placed directly onto your implant. Implants are an excellent way to restore missing teeth with a natural and aesthetic result.
VENEERS
​

Chunk 72:
Are you interested in enhancing your smile? Veeners are an excellent option and are one the least invasive ways to dramatically change your smile and provide long lasting results. Veneers are a thin, customized layer of porcelain that are bonded over your front teeth to create an extremely natural and aesthetic smile. Together, you and your dentist will design a smile with beautiful teeth that complements your face shape and size. Ask us how we can help you achieve the smile you always wanted.

Chunk 73:
WHITENING
​
Many people associate professional teeth whitening with movie stars and brides. But in fact, it is an extremely popular procedure in cosmetic dentistry. And at BayWell Dental Centre, we offer the most current teeth whitening services to achieve immediate results in just one hour of chair time.
WISDOM TEETH EXTRACTION
​

Chunk 74:
The extraction of wisdom teeth is necessary when they are prevented from properly erupting into the mouth. They may grow sideways, partially emerge in the mouth, and even remain trapped beneath the gum within the jaw. These impacted teeth can eventually cause severe infections, cavities and shift other teeth. The most serious complications occur when tumors or cysts form around the impacted wisdom teeth, resulting in the destruction of the jawbone and healthy adjacent teeth. The early removal

Chunk 75:
teeth, resulting in the destruction of the jawbone and healthy adjacent teeth. The early removal of the third molar tooth usually avoids these problems and decreases surgical risks involved with the procedure. This can be done at our office with or without sedation depending on patient specific need and preference.

Chunk 76:
DIGITAL X-RAYS
​
Our digital x-rays reduce exposure by over 85% and is eco-friendly through reducing the use of chemicals to process film the traditional way. Digital x-rays are viewed instantly on the computer monitor in each operatory in our office. This improves the way we diagnose disease and allows us to better communicate with you to make treatment decisions together.
COSMETIC DENTISTRY
​

Chunk 77:
COSMETIC DENTISTRY
​
Years ago, aesthetic improvements in dentistry often meant multiple appointments and invasive procedures. But thanks to advances in cosmetic dentistry, dental professionals these days are able to help patients achieve spectacular results in a far less painful and time-consuming fashion.
BONDING AND WHITE FILLINGS
​

Chunk 78:
BONDING AND WHITE FILLINGS
​
Many of us have gaps between the teeth. This may be a concern in the front teeth particularly. To close these gaps several options may be chosen. At times a porcelain veneer or laminate may be recommended to close the gaps. At other times bonding, or a white filling material, may be recommended to do the same.
BRIDGES
​

Chunk 79:
​
A bridge can be an excellent way to replace a missing tooth. The replacement tooth is permanent fixed to the neighbouring teeth and "bridged" together to close the space. This prevents drifting and movement of your natural teeth. A dental bridge can also be a great alternative for patients who are not candidates for implants, due to insufficient bone quantity or quality. Bridges can be made of a variety of materials, including porcelain and alloys, depending on your needs and preferences.

Chunk 80:
CROWNS
​
Dental crowns may be recommended by your dentist to restore fractured, chipped, or worn down teeth. They may also be necessary to prevent weak teeth from splitting/fracturing, especially ones that have received root canal treatment. There are many different options for modern crowns that can look extremely natural and beautiful, ranging from traditional porcelain & metal crowns, to All Ceramic Porcelain and Zirconia crowns. Ask us about CEREC Crowns and same day service!

Chunk 81:
ROOT CANAL TREATMENT
​

Chunk 82:
​
Root canal treatment may be recommended by your dentist to save your tooth from an infected, or dying nerve. This may sound scary to some people, but at our office, we make sure that you are completely numb, or frozen before we proceed with any treatment. This results in a painless procedure to remove the infection and save you from losing your tooth. Your dentist may recommend a crown after a root canal procedure to preserve the integrity of the tooth for long term success.
GUM GRAFTS
​

Chunk 83:
GUM GRAFTS
​
Gum grafting is a procedure to develop gum tissue where absent due to excessive gum recession from abrasive brushing techniques or gum disease. Receding gums can cause inflammation, tooth sensitivity and an uneven smile line. Your dentist can use a gum graft to cover the exposed root. This can be done for one tooth or several teeth to even your gum line and reduce sensitivity.
TEETH STRAIGHTENING
​

Chunk 84:
TEETH STRAIGHTENING
​
If you want to improve your smile and want healthy, straight, teeth - ask us if you are candidate for orthodontic treatment with Suresmile Clear aligners. Designed for the modern patient, these aligners will help you achieve your ideal smile fast, effectively and more discrete than ever. We will work with you to create a customized plan, and depending on the scope, treatment may take only 6-8 months.
THE STUDENT DISCOUNT DENTAL NETWORK

Chunk 85:
At Baywell Dental Centre, we are proud to be apart of the Greenshield Student Discount Network Program. If you are a student participating in a university or college dental plan, such as University of Toronto, George Brown, Ryerson, York, or OCAD, you are eligible to receive preventive care at a reduce fee. Some procedures require a co-payment if they are partially subsidized. For other dental services, there may be a co-payment if they are partially subsidized. Call us at (416) 961-6630 to

Chunk 87:
THERAPEUTIC BOTOX AND TMD
What’s involved in Therapeutic Botox® TMJ treatment?

Chunk 88:
Botox® can be injected into the temporalis and masseter muscles and works by blocking nerve signals that cause uncontrollable muscle movements, eventually relaxing the muscles. You can expect results 2-3 weeks from the time of treatment and it can remain effective for anywhere between two and six months depending on the patient. After several treatments, patients report a decreased need for touch ups and this will depend on the severity of your condition as well as metabolism.

Chunk 89:
Benefits and Risks of Therapeutic Botox® treatment

Chunk 90:
Therapeutic Botox® injections can often provide substantial relief to those suffering from soreness and pain of the TMJ while reducing the ability of muscles to engage in problematic grinding, which can also slow down worn down teeth. The potential side effects of Therapeutic Botox® treatment are mild, and usually go away within a few hours or days after treatment. Potential side effects include: inflammation, bleeding, bruising, swelling, muscle weakness, pain at injection site and allergic

Chunk 91:
inflammation, bleeding, bruising, swelling, muscle weakness, pain at injection site and allergic reactions.

Chunk 92:
Is it covered by my insurance?

Chunk 93:
Many insurances do cover Therapeutic Botox in the treatment of TMD. Our staff are experienced with submitting estimates and can do so on your behalf to assist you, just ask us!
WISDOM TOOTH REMOVAL
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUTWISDOM TEETH

Chunk 94:
A Wisdom Tooth Extraction is a routine surgical procedure to remove one or more wisdom teeth — the four permanent adult teeth that are the last to erupt at the back of your mouth. If a wisdom tooth does not have room to grow, it is considered an “impacted wisdom tooth,” and this can result in pain, infection, or another dental problem. They present between the ages of 17 – 25, and often cause discomfort due to lack of room in the jaw or angle of entry.

Chunk 95:
We use X-rays to carefully assess the problem and, if necessary, plan for extraction. Wisdom teeth are usually easier to remove at a younger (17-25) age because there is a greater probability that the roots have not fully developed and the bone surrounding the teeth is typically less dense.
​

Is Wisdom Teeth Removal Really Necessary?

Chunk 99:
It depends. We evaluate every patient on an individual basis to determine how the presence of your wisdom teeth are affecting your oral health. If you have wisdom teeth that are causing dental problems, our team will discuss the benefits of removing them.If you have impacted wisdom teeth that are not causing dental problems (asymptomatic), we will discuss the pros and cons of preventive extraction. In either case, the decision is ultimately up to the patient.

Chunk 100:
​
Can’t I just wait until my wisdom teeth hurt?
You can, but there are important benefits to removing your wisdom teeth while you are in the ideal age range(17-25) that you should be aware of:
Younger adults usually do not have fully formed wisdom teeth, which makes them easier to remove

Wisdom Tooth Surgery Healing Time

Chunk 112:
​
Wisdom Tooth Surgery Healing Time
The healing process after wisdom tooth removal surgery can vary from 7 to 10 days. Depending on the circumstances, brushing, eating, and other actions can be resumed the next day. A follow-up visit is scheduled with your dentist to assess and assist as needed with your recovery and address any post surgical concerns.As you heal from your surgery, we recommend that you follow your dentist’s instructions on:

Chunk 113:
Bleeding. Some oozing of blood may occur the first day after wisdom tooth removal. Try to avoid excessive spitting so that you do not dislodge the blood clot from the socket. Replace gauze over the extraction site as directed by your dentist or oral surgeon.

WISDOM TOOTH REMOVAL
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUTWISDOM TEETH

Chunk 152:
A Wisdom Tooth Extraction is a routine surgical procedure to remove one or more wisdom teeth — the four permanent adult teeth that are the last to erupt at the back of your mouth. If a wisdom tooth does not have room to grow, it is considered an “impacted wisdom tooth,” and this can result in pain, infection, or another dental problem. They present between the ages of 17 – 25, and often cause discomfort due to lack of room in the jaw or angle of entry.

Chunk 153:
We use X-rays to carefully assess the problem and, if necessary, plan for extraction. Wisdom teeth are usually easier to remove at a younger (17-25) age because there is a greater probability that the roots have not fully developed and the bone surrounding the teeth is typically less dense.
​

How SureSmile clear aligner therapy works

Chunk 205:
In order to know where your teeth need to go, your dentist will spend time thoughtfully designing a Digital Diagnostic Tooth Setup encompassing the principles of an ideal bite (occlusion), gum health, skeletal proportions and space restrictions. We then order a series of custom-fabricated aligners designed apply a light pressure on your teeth and promotes tooth movement into their ideal position gradually. You will wear your aligners for 20 to 22 hours per day and switch them out for the next

Chunk 207:
SureSmile Aligners are loved by patients and dentists alike because it is:

Therapeutic Botox Injections for TMJ
THERAPUTIC BOTOX INJECTIONSFOR TMD
Do you suffer from muscle tension and headaches? Are you clenching and grinding?

Chunk 223:
Therapeutic Botox® treatment for TMJ and Jaw Tension may be the treatment you were looking for. You may have heard about Therapeutic Botox in the treatment of jaw pain and tension headaches from clenching and grinding. Perhaps you have already tried traditional remedies such as night guards, massages, and anti-inflammatory medications, and are still in pain. Therapeutic Botox is considered a novel treatment to address jaw pain. We have compiled a list of FAQ's to help answer your questions

Chunk 224:
novel treatment to address jaw pain. We have compiled a list of FAQ's to help answer your questions about this procedure.

Chunk 225:
What is TMD?
The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is located on both sides of your head where the jaw bone meets the skull. This joint is used when talking, eating, swallowing and other daily activities. When this joint becomes overworked through excessive grinding or clenching, you may suffer severe tension headaches, sharp pain of the jaw, facial muscle aches and even pain/sensitivity in your teeth. When you have pain in the jaw joint, we call this TMD, or Temporomandibular Disorder.

Chunk 226:
What is Therapeutic Botox® and how does it help my TMJ?
​

Chunk 227:
Botox® is commonly used to lessen the tell-tale signs of aging, such as wrinkles and frown lines, however recently these injections are being used more frequently in dental procedures as an alternative treatment for TMJ, tension headaches, clenching/grinding and sleep bruxism. Therapeutic Botox® relieves tension by making the muscle unable to engage in the powerful, often unconscious movement. Patients who have received injections experience significant improvements in pain, function, ability

Chunk 228:
who have received injections experience significant improvements in pain, function, ability to open their mouth and levels of tenderness.

Chunk 229:
​
What’s involved in Therapeutic Botox® TMJ treatment?

Chunk 230:
Botox® can be injected into the temporalis and masseter muscles and works by blocking nerve signals that cause uncontrollable muscle movements, eventually relaxing the muscles. You can expect results 2-3 weeks from the time of treatment and it can remain effective for anywhere between two and six months depending on the patient. After several treatments, patients report a decreased need for touch ups and this will depend on the severity of your condition as well as metabolism.
​

Chunk 231:
​
Benefits and Risks of Therapeutic Botox® treatment

Chunk 232:
Therapeutic Botox® injections can often provide substantial relief to those suffering from soreness and pain of the TMJ while reducing the ability of muscles to engage in problematic grinding, which can also slow down worn down teeth.The potential side effects of Therapeutic Botox® treatment are mild, and usually go away within a few hours or days after treatment. Potential side effects include: inflammation, bleeding, bruising, swelling, muscle weakness, pain at injection site and allergic

Is it covered by my insurance?

QUESTIONS PATIENTS MAY HAVE REGARDING THE DENTAL OFFICE AND COVID-19
Dr. Jeanie Luong discusses and Dentistry and COVID Q&A with Charlotte from Opencare. She discusses how to see a dentist during COVID, how to avoid an emergency, and what your visit might look like when dental offices re-open.
HOW TO AVOID DENTAL EMERGENCIES DURING COVID-19

Chunk 256:
HOW TO AVOID DENTAL EMERGENCIES DURING COVID-19
1. Avoid chewing hard foods, especially if you have large fillings or crowns. Weakened tooth structure has a higher risk of cracking. Hold off on items such as nuts, crusty bread, bones and ice. If in doubt, skip it.
2. Moderate consumption of acidic beverages. Repeated insults from acidic beverage such as juice, beer, wine, pop, and sports drinks can erode enamel and cause sensitivity. Be mindful of how frequent your consumption is.

Chunk 257:
3. Brush gently around your gums. There is repeated messaging about brushing well during COVID, but make sure not to overdo it. Be kind to your gums and take your time to brush gently. Make sure to always use a soft or extra soft toothbrush.
Despite your best efforts, you may have a dental issue that requires consultation and treatment. Contact Dr. Luong or Dr. Sydney Cormier for advice atcontact@baywelldental.com

DENTAL SERVICES
GENERAL DENTISTRY
​
If you're looking for a dental office that employs friendly and helpful staff, BayWell Dental is a practice worth visiting. Our dentists were trained at the University of Toronto and are dedicated to staying current with new advancements and techniques to benefit your teeth and enhance your smile. Our practice was established in 1973, and ever since we've been committed to providing exceptional dental care.
EMERGENCY DENTISTRY
​

Chunk 272:
EMERGENCY DENTISTRY
​
Dental problems don't always happen during regularly scheduled office hours. This can be disruptive and can range from a minor inconvenience to severe pain. It may happen in the form of a chipped tooth, broken filling, oral trauma, infection and possibly swelling. Here at BayWell Dental, we offer flexible morning and evening hours, including Saturdays to accommodate your emergency needs.
DENTAL CLEANINGS & PREVENTIVE CARE
​

Chunk 273:
Regular dental checkups and cleanings are essential to maintaining your oral health. During your cleaning appointment, your hygienist and dentist will inspect for signs of tooth decay, gum disease, gum recession and tooth wear. They will do an preliminary oral cancer screen and assess other problems that you may not even be aware of. This is all in addition to providing a thorough cleaning and polish. Our goal is to help you maintain a healthy smile by designing a periodontal program to suit

Chunk 274:
polish. Our goal is to help you maintain a healthy smile by designing a periodontal program to suit your needs. If its been more than 6 months, call us to book a cleaning and check up today!

Chunk 275:
IMPLANTS
​
Dental implants have revolutionized the way we restore missing teeth. A dental implant is a bone friendly titanium post that is placed into the missing tooth socket. The implant then integrates permanently with your own jaw bone. After a few months, you are then able to receive a crown placed directly onto your implant. Implants are an excellent way to restore missing teeth with a natural and aesthetic result.
VENEERS
​

Chunk 276:
Are you interested in enhancing your smile? Veeners are an excellent option and are one the least invasive ways to dramatically change your smile and provide long lasting results. Veneers are a thin, customized layer of porcelain that are bonded over your front teeth to create an extremely natural and aesthetic smile. Together, you and your dentist will design a smile with beautiful teeth that complements your face shape and size. Ask us how we can help you achieve the smile you always wanted.

Chunk 277:
WHITENING
​
Many people associate professional teeth whitening with movie stars and brides. But in fact, it is an extremely popular procedure in cosmetic dentistry. And at BayWell Dental Centre, we offer the most current teeth whitening services to achieve immediate results in just one hour of chair time.
WISDOM TEETH EXTRACTION
​

Chunk 278:
The extraction of wisdom teeth is necessary when they are prevented from properly erupting into the mouth. They may grow sideways, partially emerge in the mouth, and even remain trapped beneath the gum within the jaw. These impacted teeth can eventually cause severe infections, cavities and shift other teeth. The most serious complications occur when tumors or cysts form around the impacted wisdom teeth, resulting in the destruction of the jawbone and healthy adjacent teeth. The early removal

Chunk 279:
teeth, resulting in the destruction of the jawbone and healthy adjacent teeth. The early removal of the third molar tooth usually avoids these problems and decreases surgical risks involved with the procedure. This can be done at our office with or without sedation depending on patient specific need and preference.

Chunk 280:
DIGITAL X-RAYS
​
Our digital x-rays reduce exposure by over 85% and is eco-friendly through reducing the use of chemicals to process film the traditional way. Digital x-rays are viewed instantly on the computer monitor in each operatory in our office. This improves the way we diagnose disease and allows us to better communicate with you to make treatment decisions together.
COSMETIC DENTISTRY
​

Chunk 281:
COSMETIC DENTISTRY
​
Years ago, aesthetic improvements in dentistry often meant multiple appointments and invasive procedures. But thanks to advances in cosmetic dentistry, dental professionals these days are able to help patients achieve spectacular results in a far less painful and time-consuming fashion.
BONDING AND WHITE FILLINGS
​

Chunk 282:
BONDING AND WHITE FILLINGS
​
Many of us have gaps between the teeth. This may be a concern in the front teeth particularly. To close these gaps several options may be chosen. At times a porcelain veneer or laminate may be recommended to close the gaps. At other times bonding, or a white filling material, may be recommended to do the same.
BRIDGES
​

Chunk 283:
​
A bridge can be an excellent way to replace a missing tooth. The replacement tooth is permanent fixed to the neighbouring teeth and "bridged" together to close the space. This prevents drifting and movement of your natural teeth. A dental bridge can also be a great alternative for patients who are not candidates for implants, due to insufficient bone quantity or quality. Bridges can be made of a variety of materials, including porcelain and alloys, depending on your needs and preferences.

Chunk 284:
CROWNS
​
Dental crowns may be recommended by your dentist to restore fractured, chipped, or worn down teeth. They may also be necessary to prevent weak teeth from splitting/fracturing, especially ones that have received root canal treatment. There are many different options for modern crowns that can look extremely natural and beautiful, ranging from traditional porcelain & metal crowns, to All Ceramic Porcelain and Zirconia crowns. Ask us about CEREC Crowns and same day service!

Chunk 285:
ROOT CANAL TREATMENT
​

Chunk 286:
​
Root canal treatment may be recommended by your dentist to save your tooth from an infected, or dying nerve. This may sound scary to some people, but at our office, we make sure that you are completely numb, or frozen before we proceed with any treatment. This results in a painless procedure to remove the infection and save you from losing your tooth. Your dentist may recommend a crown after a root canal procedure to preserve the integrity of the tooth for long term success.
GUM GRAFTS
​

Chunk 287:
GUM GRAFTS
​
Gum grafting is a procedure to develop gum tissue where absent due to excessive gum recession from abrasive brushing techniques or gum disease. Receding gums can cause inflammation, tooth sensitivity and an uneven smile line. Your dentist can use a gum graft to cover the exposed root. This can be done for one tooth or several teeth to even your gum line and reduce sensitivity.

THERAPEUTIC BOTOX AND TMD
What’s involved in Therapeutic Botox® TMJ treatment?

Chunk 292:
Botox® can be injected into the temporalis and masseter muscles and works by blocking nerve signals that cause uncontrollable muscle movements, eventually relaxing the muscles. You can expect results 2-3 weeks from the time of treatment and it can remain effective for anywhere between two and six months depending on the patient. After several treatments, patients report a decreased need for touch ups and this will depend on the severity of your condition as well as metabolism.

Chunk 293:
Benefits and Risks of Therapeutic Botox® treatment

Chunk 294:
Therapeutic Botox® injections can often provide substantial relief to those suffering from soreness and pain of the TMJ while reducing the ability of muscles to engage in problematic grinding, which can also slow down worn down teeth. The potential side effects of Therapeutic Botox® treatment are mild, and usually go away within a few hours or days after treatment. Potential side effects include: inflammation, bleeding, bruising, swelling, muscle weakness, pain at injection site and allergic

WISDOM TOOTH REMOVAL
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUTWISDOM TEETH

Chunk 298:
A Wisdom Tooth Extraction is a routine surgical procedure to remove one or more wisdom teeth — the four permanent adult teeth that are the last to erupt at the back of your mouth. If a wisdom tooth does not have room to grow, it is considered an “impacted wisdom tooth,” and this can result in pain, infection, or another dental problem. They present between the ages of 17 – 25, and often cause discomfort due to lack of room in the jaw or angle of entry.

Chunk 299:
We use X-rays to carefully assess the problem and, if necessary, plan for extraction. Wisdom teeth are usually easier to remove at a younger (17-25) age because there is a greater probability that the roots have not fully developed and the bone surrounding the teeth is typically less dense.
​
Problems with Impacted Wisdom Teeth Include:

Chunk 302:
Is Wisdom Teeth Removal Really Necessary?

Chunk 303:
It depends. We evaluate every patient on an individual basis to determine how the presence of your wisdom teeth are affecting your oral health. If you have wisdom teeth that are causing dental problems, our team will discuss the benefits of removing them.If you have impacted wisdom teeth that are not causing dental problems (asymptomatic), we will discuss the pros and cons of preventive extraction. In either case, the decision is ultimately up to the patient.
​

Chunk 304:
​
Can’t I just wait until my wisdom teeth hurt?
You can, but there are important benefits to removing your wisdom teeth while you are in the ideal age range(17-25) that you should be aware of:
Younger adults usually do not have fully formed wisdom teeth, which makes them easier to remove

Chunk 316:
​
Wisdom Tooth Surgery Healing Time
The healing process after wisdom tooth removal surgery can vary from 7 to 10 days. Depending on the circumstances, brushing, eating, and other actions can be resumed the next day. A follow-up visit is scheduled with your dentist to assess and assist as needed with your recovery and address any post surgical concerns.As you heal from your surgery, we recommend that you follow your dentist’s instructions on:

Chunk 317:
Bleeding. Some oozing of blood may occur the first day after wisdom tooth removal. Try to avoid excessive spitting so that you do not dislodge the blood clot from the socket. Replace gauze over the extraction site as directed by your dentist or oral surgeon.

Having a cerec crown is beneficial for a number of reasons. In the hands of a skilled dentist, it is extremely accurate. We have found that a CEREC crown requires little to no adjustment prior to fitting in the mouth. Second, because it is a digital scan, it means that a CEREC crown does not require impression materials or trays - that means no goop in your mouth! Third, with a many different choices in materials and colour, we will select a tooth colour that mimics your tooth and looks

DENTAL SERVICES
GENERAL DENTISTRY
​
If you're looking for a dental office that employs friendly and helpful staff, BayWell Dental is a practice worth visiting. Our dentists were trained at the University of Toronto and are dedicated to staying current with new advancements and techniques to benefit your teeth and enhance your smile. Our practice was established in 1973, and ever since we've been committed to providing exceptional dental care.
EMERGENCY DENTISTRY
​

Chunk 574:
EMERGENCY DENTISTRY
​
Dental problems don't always happen during regularly scheduled office hours. This can be disruptive and can range from a minor inconvenience to severe pain. It may happen in the form of a chipped tooth, broken filling, oral trauma, infection and possibly swelling. Here at BayWell Dental, we offer flexible morning and evening hours, including Saturdays to accommodate your emergency needs.
DENTAL CLEANINGS & PREVENTIVE CARE
​

Chunk 575:
Regular dental checkups and cleanings are essential to maintaining your oral health. During your cleaning appointment, your hygienist and dentist will inspect for signs of tooth decay, gum disease, gum recession and tooth wear. They will do an preliminary oral cancer screen and assess other problems that you may not even be aware of. This is all in addition to providing a thorough cleaning and polish. Our goal is to help you maintain a healthy smile by designing a periodontal program to suit

Chunk 576:
polish. Our goal is to help you maintain a healthy smile by designing a periodontal program to suit your needs. If its been more than 6 months, call us to book a cleaning and check up today!

Chunk 577:
IMPLANTS
​
Dental implants have revolutionized the way we restore missing teeth. A dental implant is a bone friendly titanium post that is placed into the missing tooth socket. The implant then integrates permanently with your own jaw bone. After a few months, you are then able to receive a crown placed directly onto your implant. Implants are an excellent way to restore missing teeth with a natural and aesthetic result.
VENEERS
​

Chunk 578:
Are you interested in enhancing your smile? Veeners are an excellent option and are one the least invasive ways to dramatically change your smile and provide long lasting results. Veneers are a thin, customized layer of porcelain that are bonded over your front teeth to create an extremely natural and aesthetic smile. Together, you and your dentist will design a smile with beautiful teeth that complements your face shape and size. Ask us how we can help you achieve the smile you always wanted.

Chunk 579:
WHITENING
​
Many people associate professional teeth whitening with movie stars and brides. But in fact, it is an extremely popular procedure in cosmetic dentistry. And at BayWell Dental Centre, we offer the most current teeth whitening services to achieve immediate results in just one hour of chair time.
WISDOM TEETH EXTRACTION
​

Chunk 580:
The extraction of wisdom teeth is necessary when they are prevented from properly erupting into the mouth. They may grow sideways, partially emerge in the mouth, and even remain trapped beneath the gum within the jaw. These impacted teeth can eventually cause severe infections, cavities and shift other teeth. The most serious complications occur when tumors or cysts form around the impacted wisdom teeth, resulting in the destruction of the jawbone and healthy adjacent teeth. The early removal

Chunk 581:
teeth, resulting in the destruction of the jawbone and healthy adjacent teeth. The early removal of the third molar tooth usually avoids these problems and decreases surgical risks involved with the procedure. This can be done at our office with or without sedation depending on patient specific need and preference.

Chunk 582:
DIGITAL X-RAYS
​
Our digital x-rays reduce exposure by over 85% and is eco-friendly through reducing the use of chemicals to process film the traditional way. Digital x-rays are viewed instantly on the computer monitor in each operatory in our office. This improves the way we diagnose disease and allows us to better communicate with you to make treatment decisions together.
COSMETIC DENTISTRY
​

Chunk 583:
COSMETIC DENTISTRY
​
Years ago, aesthetic improvements in dentistry often meant multiple appointments and invasive procedures. But thanks to advances in cosmetic dentistry, dental professionals these days are able to help patients achieve spectacular results in a far less painful and time-consuming fashion.
BONDING AND WHITE FILLINGS
​

Chunk 584:
BONDING AND WHITE FILLINGS
​
Many of us have gaps between the teeth. This may be a concern in the front teeth particularly. To close these gaps several options may be chosen. At times a porcelain veneer or laminate may be recommended to close the gaps. At other times bonding, or a white filling material, may be recommended to do the same.
BRIDGES
​

Chunk 585:
​
A bridge can be an excellent way to replace a missing tooth. The replacement tooth is permanent fixed to the neighbouring teeth and "bridged" together to close the space. This prevents drifting and movement of your natural teeth. A dental bridge can also be a great alternative for patients who are not candidates for implants, due to insufficient bone quantity or quality. Bridges can be made of a variety of materials, including porcelain and alloys, depending on your needs and preferences.

Chunk 586:
CROWNS
​
Dental crowns may be recommended by your dentist to restore fractured, chipped, or worn down teeth. They may also be necessary to prevent weak teeth from splitting/fracturing, especially ones that have received root canal treatment. There are many different options for modern crowns that can look extremely natural and beautiful, ranging from traditional porcelain & metal crowns, to All Ceramic Porcelain and Zirconia crowns. Ask us about CEREC Crowns and same day service!

Chunk 587:
ROOT CANAL TREATMENT
​

Chunk 588:
​
Root canal treatment may be recommended by your dentist to save your tooth from an infected, or dying nerve. This may sound scary to some people, but at our office, we make sure that you are completely numb, or frozen before we proceed with any treatment. This results in a painless procedure to remove the infection and save you from losing your tooth. Your dentist may recommend a crown after a root canal procedure to preserve the integrity of the tooth for long term success.
GUM GRAFTS
​

Chunk 589:
GUM GRAFTS
​
Gum grafting is a procedure to develop gum tissue where absent due to excessive gum recession from abrasive brushing techniques or gum disease. Receding gums can cause inflammation, tooth sensitivity and an uneven smile line. Your dentist can use a gum graft to cover the exposed root. This can be done for one tooth or several teeth to even your gum line and reduce sensitivity.
TEETH STRAIGHTENING
​

Chunk 590:
TEETH STRAIGHTENING
​
If you want to improve your smile and want healthy, straight, teeth - ask us if you are candidate for orthodontic treatment with Suresmile Clear aligners. Designed for the modern patient, these aligners will help you achieve your ideal smile fast, effectively and more discrete than ever. We will work with you to create a customized plan, and depending on the scope, treatment may take only 6-8 months.
THE STUDENT DISCOUNT DENTAL NETWORK

Chunk 591:

Chunk 593:
THERAPEUTIC BOTOX AND TMD
What’s involved in Therapeutic Botox® TMJ treatment?

Chunk 594:
Botox® can be injected into the temporalis and masseter muscles and works by blocking nerve signals that cause uncontrollable muscle movements, eventually relaxing the muscles. You can expect results 2-3 weeks from the time of treatment and it can remain effective for anywhere between two and six months depending on the patient. After several treatments, patients report a decreased need for touch ups and this will depend on the severity of your condition as well as metabolism.

Chunk 595:
Benefits and Risks of Therapeutic Botox® treatment

Chunk 596:
Therapeutic Botox® injections can often provide substantial relief to those suffering from soreness and pain of the TMJ while reducing the ability of muscles to engage in problematic grinding, which can also slow down worn down teeth. The potential side effects of Therapeutic Botox® treatment are mild, and usually go away within a few hours or days after treatment. Potential side effects include: inflammation, bleeding, bruising, swelling, muscle weakness, pain at injection site and allergic

Chunk 597:
inflammation, bleeding, bruising, swelling, muscle weakness, pain at injection site and allergic reactions.

Chunk 598:
Is it covered by my insurance?

Chunk 599:
Many insurances do cover Therapeutic Botox in the treatment of TMD. Our staff are experienced with submitting estimates and can do so on your behalf to assist you, just ask us!
WISDOM TOOTH REMOVAL
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUTWISDOM TEETH

Chunk 600:
A Wisdom Tooth Extraction is a routine surgical procedure to remove one or more wisdom teeth — the four permanent adult teeth that are the last to erupt at the back of your mouth. If a wisdom tooth does not have room to grow, it is considered an “impacted wisdom tooth,” and this can result in pain, infection, or another dental problem. They present between the ages of 17 – 25, and often cause discomfort due to lack of room in the jaw or angle of entry.

Chunk 601:
We use X-rays to carefully assess the problem and, if necessary, plan for extraction. Wisdom teeth are usually easier to remove at a younger (17-25) age because there is a greater probability that the roots have not fully developed and the bone surrounding the teeth is typically less dense.
​
Problems with Impacted Wisdom Teeth Include:

Chunk 604:
Is Wisdom Teeth Removal Really Necessary?

Chunk 605:
It depends. We evaluate every patient on an individual basis to determine how the presence of your wisdom teeth are affecting your oral health. If you have wisdom teeth that are causing dental problems, our team will discuss the benefits of removing them.If you have impacted wisdom teeth that are not causing dental problems (asymptomatic), we will discuss the pros and cons of preventive extraction. In either case, the decision is ultimately up to the patient.
​

Chunk 606:
​
Can’t I just wait until my wisdom teeth hurt?
You can, but there are important benefits to removing your wisdom teeth while you are in the ideal age range(17-25) that you should be aware of:
Younger adults usually do not have fully formed wisdom teeth, which makes them easier to remove
Younger adults usually do not have fully formed wisdom teeth, which makes them easier to remove

Sedation Options to Address Dental Anxiety
A wisdom tooth extraction can be a stressful experience for many patients. We offer minimal conscious sedation and oral moderate sedation to relieve anxiety and improve patient experience.
Minimal sedation (Laughing Gas): Depending on the dose administered, this is a relaxed state where patients can walk, talk, and breathe normally. Patients are not asleep.

Wisdom Tooth Surgery Healing Time

Chunk 618:
​
Wisdom Tooth Surgery Healing Time
The healing process after wisdom tooth removal surgery can vary from 7 to 10 days. Depending on the circumstances, brushing, eating, and other actions can be resumed the next day. A follow-up visit is scheduled with your dentist to assess and assist as needed with your recovery and address any post surgical concerns.As you heal from your surgery, we recommend that you follow your dentist’s instructions on:

Chunk 619:
Bleeding. Some oozing of blood may occur the first day after wisdom tooth removal. Try to avoid excessive spitting so that you do not dislodge the blood clot from the socket. Replace gauze over the extraction site as directed by your dentist or oral surgeon.

Pain management. You may be able to manage pain with an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), or a prescription pain medication from your dentist. Prescription pain medication may be especially helpful if bone has been removed during the procedure. Holding a cold pack against your jaw also may relieve pain.

Having a cerec crown is beneficial for a number of reasons. In the hands of a skilled dentist, it is extremely accurate. We have found that a CEREC crown requires little to no adjustment prior to fitting in the mouth. Second, because it is a digital scan, it means that a CEREC crown does not require impression materials or trays - that means no goop in your mouth! Third, with a many different choices in materials and colour, we will select a tooth colour that mimics your tooth and looks

How SureSmile clear aligner therapy works

Chunk 1123:
In order to know where your teeth need to go, your dentist will spend time thoughtfully designing a Digital Diagnostic Tooth Setup encompassing the principles of an ideal bite (occlusion), gum health, skeletal proportions and space restrictions. We then order a series of custom-fabricated aligners designed apply a light pressure on your teeth and promotes tooth movement into their ideal position gradually. You will wear your aligners for 20 to 22 hours per day and switch them out for the next

DENTAL SERVICES
GENERAL DENTISTRY
​
If you're looking for a dental office that employs friendly and helpful staff, BayWell Dental is a practice worth visiting. Our dentists were trained at the University of Toronto and are dedicated to staying current with new advancements and techniques to benefit your teeth and enhance your smile. Our practice was established in 1973, and ever since we've been committed to providing exceptional dental care.
EMERGENCY DENTISTRY
​

Chunk 1187:
EMERGENCY DENTISTRY
​
Dental problems don't always happen during regularly scheduled office hours. This can be disruptive and can range from a minor inconvenience to severe pain. It may happen in the form of a chipped tooth, broken filling, oral trauma, infection and possibly swelling. Here at BayWell Dental, we offer flexible morning and evening hours, including Saturdays to accommodate your emergency needs.
DENTAL CLEANINGS & PREVENTIVE CARE
​

Chunk 1188:
Regular dental checkups and cleanings are essential to maintaining your oral health. During your cleaning appointment, your hygienist and dentist will inspect for signs of tooth decay, gum disease, gum recession and tooth wear. They will do an preliminary oral cancer screen and assess other problems that you may not even be aware of. This is all in addition to providing a thorough cleaning and polish. Our goal is to help you maintain a healthy smile by designing a periodontal program to suit

Chunk 1189:
polish. Our goal is to help you maintain a healthy smile by designing a periodontal program to suit your needs. If its been more than 6 months, call us to book a cleaning and check up today!

Chunk 1190:
IMPLANTS
​
Dental implants have revolutionized the way we restore missing teeth. A dental implant is a bone friendly titanium post that is placed into the missing tooth socket. The implant then integrates permanently with your own jaw bone. After a few months, you are then able to receive a crown placed directly onto your implant. Implants are an excellent way to restore missing teeth with a natural and aesthetic result.
VENEERS
​

Chunk 1191:
Are you interested in enhancing your smile? Veeners are an excellent option and are one the least invasive ways to dramatically change your smile and provide long lasting results. Veneers are a thin, customized layer of porcelain that are bonded over your front teeth to create an extremely natural and aesthetic smile. Together, you and your dentist will design a smile with beautiful teeth that complements your face shape and size. Ask us how we can help you achieve the smile you always wanted.

Chunk 1192:
WHITENING
​
Many people associate professional teeth whitening with movie stars and brides. But in fact, it is an extremely popular procedure in cosmetic dentistry. And at BayWell Dental Centre, we offer the most current teeth whitening services to achieve immediate results in just one hour of chair time.
WISDOM TEETH EXTRACTION
​

Chunk 1193:
The extraction of wisdom teeth is necessary when they are prevented from properly erupting into the mouth. They may grow sideways, partially emerge in the mouth, and even remain trapped beneath the gum within the jaw. These impacted teeth can eventually cause severe infections, cavities and shift other teeth. The most serious complications occur when tumors or cysts form around the impacted wisdom teeth, resulting in the destruction of the jawbone and healthy adjacent teeth. The early removal

Chunk 1194:
teeth, resulting in the destruction of the jawbone and healthy adjacent teeth. The early removal of the third molar tooth usually avoids these problems and decreases surgical risks involved with the procedure. This can be done at our office with or without sedation depending on patient specific need and preference.

Chunk 1195:
DIGITAL X-RAYS
​
Our digital x-rays reduce exposure by over 85% and is eco-friendly through reducing the use of chemicals to process film the traditional way. Digital x-rays are viewed instantly on the computer monitor in each operatory in our office. This improves the way we diagnose disease and allows us to better communicate with you to make treatment decisions together.
COSMETIC DENTISTRY
​

Chunk 1196:
COSMETIC DENTISTRY
​
Years ago, aesthetic improvements in dentistry often meant multiple appointments and invasive procedures. But thanks to advances in cosmetic dentistry, dental professionals these days are able to help patients achieve spectacular results in a far less painful and time-consuming fashion.
BONDING AND WHITE FILLINGS
​

Chunk 1197:
BONDING AND WHITE FILLINGS
​
Many of us have gaps between the teeth. This may be a concern in the front teeth particularly. To close these gaps several options may be chosen. At times a porcelain veneer or laminate may be recommended to close the gaps. At other times bonding, or a white filling material, may be recommended to do the same.
BRIDGES
​

Chunk 1198:
​
A bridge can be an excellent way to replace a missing tooth. The replacement tooth is permanent fixed to the neighbouring teeth and "bridged" together to close the space. This prevents drifting and movement of your natural teeth. A dental bridge can also be a great alternative for patients who are not candidates for implants, due to insufficient bone quantity or quality. Bridges can be made of a variety of materials, including porcelain and alloys, depending on your needs and preferences.

Chunk 1199:
CROWNS
​
Dental crowns may be recommended by your dentist to restore fractured, chipped, or worn down teeth. They may also be necessary to prevent weak teeth from splitting/fracturing, especially ones that have received root canal treatment. There are many different options for modern crowns that can look extremely natural and beautiful, ranging from traditional porcelain & metal crowns, to All Ceramic Porcelain and Zirconia crowns. Ask us about CEREC Crowns and same day service!

Chunk 1200:
ROOT CANAL TREATMENT
​

Chunk 1201:
​
Root canal treatment may be recommended by your dentist to save your tooth from an infected, or dying nerve. This may sound scary to some people, but at our office, we make sure that you are completely numb, or frozen before we proceed with any treatment. This results in a painless procedure to remove the infection and save you from losing your tooth. Your dentist may recommend a crown after a root canal procedure to preserve the integrity of the tooth for long term success.
GUM GRAFTS
​

Chunk 1202:
GUM GRAFTS
​
Gum grafting is a procedure to develop gum tissue where absent due to excessive gum recession from abrasive brushing techniques or gum disease. Receding gums can cause inflammation, tooth sensitivity and an uneven smile line. Your dentist can use a gum graft to cover the exposed root. This can be done for one tooth or several teeth to even your gum line and reduce sensitivity.
TEETH STRAIGHTENING
​

Chunk 1203:
TEETH STRAIGHTENING
​
If you want to improve your smile and want healthy, straight, teeth - ask us if you are candidate for orthodontic treatment with Suresmile Clear aligners. Designed for the modern patient, these aligners will help you achieve your ideal smile fast, effectively and more discrete than ever. We will work with you to create a customized plan, and depending on the scope, treatment may take only 6-8 months.

Chunk 1206:
THERAPEUTIC BOTOX AND TMD
What’s involved in Therapeutic Botox® TMJ treatment?

Chunk 1207:
Botox® can be injected into the temporalis and masseter muscles and works by blocking nerve signals that cause uncontrollable muscle movements, eventually relaxing the muscles. You can expect results 2-3 weeks from the time of treatment and it can remain effective for anywhere between two and six months depending on the patient. After several treatments, patients report a decreased need for touch ups and this will depend on the severity of your condition as well as metabolism.

Chunk 1208:
Benefits and Risks of Therapeutic Botox® treatment

Chunk 1209:
Therapeutic Botox® injections can often provide substantial relief to those suffering from soreness and pain of the TMJ while reducing the ability of muscles to engage in problematic grinding, which can also slow down worn down teeth. The potential side effects of Therapeutic Botox® treatment are mild, and usually go away within a few hours or days after treatment. Potential side effects include: inflammation, bleeding, bruising, swelling, muscle weakness, pain at injection site and allergic

Is it covered by my insurance?

Chunk 1212:
Many insurances do cover Therapeutic Botox in the treatment of TMD. Our staff are experienced with submitting estimates and can do so on your behalf to assist you, just ask us!
WISDOM TOOTH REMOVAL
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUTWISDOM TEETH

Chunk 1213:
A Wisdom Tooth Extraction is a routine surgical procedure to remove one or more wisdom teeth — the four permanent adult teeth that are the last to erupt at the back of your mouth. If a wisdom tooth does not have room to grow, it is considered an “impacted wisdom tooth,” and this can result in pain, infection, or another dental problem. They present between the ages of 17 – 25, and often cause discomfort due to lack of room in the jaw or angle of entry.

Chunk 1214:
We use X-rays to carefully assess the problem and, if necessary, plan for extraction. Wisdom teeth are usually easier to remove at a younger (17-25) age because there is a greater probability that the roots have not fully developed and the bone surrounding the teeth is typically less dense.

Problems with Impacted Wisdom Teeth Include:

Is Wisdom Teeth Removal Really Necessary?

Chunk 1218:
It depends. We evaluate every patient on an individual basis to determine how the presence of your wisdom teeth are affecting your oral health. If you have wisdom teeth that are causing dental problems, our team will discuss the benefits of removing them.If you have impacted wisdom teeth that are not causing dental problems (asymptomatic), we will discuss the pros and cons of preventive extraction. In either case, the decision is ultimately up to the patient.

Chunk 1219:
​
Can’t I just wait until my wisdom teeth hurt?
You can, but there are important benefits to removing your wisdom teeth while you are in the ideal age range(17-25) that you should be aware of:
Younger adults usually do not have fully formed wisdom teeth, which makes them easier to remove

Sedation Options to Address Dental Anxiety
A wisdom tooth extraction can be a stressful experience for many patients. We offer minimal conscious sedation and oral moderate sedation to relieve anxiety and improve patient experience.
Minimal sedation (Laughing Gas): Depending on the dose administered, this is a relaxed state where patients can walk, talk, and breathe normally. Patients are not asleep.

Wisdom Tooth Surgery Healing Time

Chunk 1231:
​
Wisdom Tooth Surgery Healing Time
The healing process after wisdom tooth removal surgery can vary from 7 to 10 days. Depending on the circumstances, brushing, eating, and other actions can be resumed the next day. A follow-up visit is scheduled with your dentist to assess and assist as needed with your recovery and address any post surgical concerns.As you heal from your surgery, we recommend that you follow your dentist’s instructions on:

Chunk 1232:
Bleeding. Some oozing of blood may occur the first day after wisdom tooth removal. Try to avoid excessive spitting so that you do not dislodge the blood clot from the socket. Replace gauze over the extraction site as directed by your dentist or oral surgeon.

Chunk 1234:
Pain management. You may be able to manage pain with an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), or a prescription pain medication from your dentist. Prescription pain medication may be especially helpful if bone has been removed during the procedure. Holding a cold pack against your jaw also may relieve pain.

Chunk 1238:
Beverages. Drink lots of water after the surgery. Avoid alcoholic, caffeinated, carbonated or hot beverages in the first 24 hours. Avoid drinking with a straw for at least a week because the sucking action can dislodge the blood clot from the socket.

Cleaning your mouth. Do not brush your teeth, rinse your mouth, spit or use mouthwash during the first 24 hours after surgery. You may be told to resume brushing your teeth after the first 24 hours. Be particularly gentle near the surgical wound when brushing and gently rinse your mouth with warm salt water every two hours and after meals for a week.

Having a cerec crown is beneficial for a number of reasons. In the hands of a skilled dentist, it is extremely accurate. We have found that a CEREC crown requires little to no adjustment prior to fitting in the mouth. Second, because it is a digital scan, it means that a CEREC crown does not require impression materials or trays - that means no goop in your mouth! Third, with a many different choices in materials and colour, we will select a tooth colour that mimics your tooth and looks

They are bonded to your tooth are made of the strongest dental materials available and will last you many years to come. Finally, CEREC crowns are CONVENIENT for you, the patient. Because a CEREC crown can be done in one appointment, you do not need to take time off work or school for a second insertion appointment - your crown will be inserted on the same day.

Kendra is absolutely amazing! I have been working with her for the past 3 years, and literally from the first month I told her I thought that maybe she was an angel because of how much she has helped me! She has been helping with various aspects of my small business, including website redesign, social media, SEO, promo materials, etc. Kendra is incredibly talented and her creative skills are amazing – it just seems to come naturally to her. She is very organized and is great at keeping you

Chunk 1373:
amazing – it just seems to come naturally to her. She is very organized and is great at keeping you updated and in the loop. She is also very patient and accessible. The thing that I love most about Kendra is that she truly wants to see you succeed and takes a genuine interest in your business. I’ve told her countless times that she always makes me feel better when I’m feeling discouraged - she is a great cheerleader! I highly recommend Kendra!
