Chunk 105:
Our office prides itself on providing a very high standard of dental care at a very fair price. Please know that dental insurance is intended to cover some, but not all, of the costs of your dental care. Not all dental plans are the same, and not all treatments are eligible or fully reimbursable.

Direct Billing
We are pleased to offer Direct Billing (also called “Assignment of Benefits”). Our administrative team is happy to electronically submit your insurance papers directly to your insurance company on your behalf and accept their payment directly to our office. You only pay the difference your company will not cover. Unfortunately, there are a few insurance companies that will not allow payment to come to the office, therefore payment in full for services is required.

Chunk 109:
Please note that despite our efforts, due to the Canadian Personal Privacy Act, we have limited access to any specific information from your dental insurance company regarding your plan. It is your responsibility to know the parameters of your dental coverage plan and to provide our office with accurate and current insurance information.

Chunk 129:
Please understand that it is ultimately your responsibility to keep track of any upcoming dental appointment. As a courtesy, we send outhygiene reminders a few weeks before a requested appointment, and we make confirmation calls or emails two weeks before hygiene appointments. As well, we send a courtesy reminder the day before all appointments. Although we make every effort to contact you before any appointment, it is ultimately your responsibility to ensure that you will be at your

Chunk 130:
you before any appointment, it is ultimately your responsibility to ensure that you will be at your appointment unless other arrangements have been made in advance with our office.

Chunk 131:
Due to a continuous high demand for prime appointment times, we require a minimum of 2 business days’ notice per appointment should you need to reschedule or cancel your appointment. Because we value your time, we do not double book our clients. As such, your appointment is a valuable time that the doctor has set aside, especially for you. Where insufficient notice is given, a missed appointment fee may be charged to you, or we may require you to prepay to reserve your next appointment.

Chunk 132:
Our goal is always to provide you with a pleasant experience. We strive to serve you to the very best of our ability, and we are committed to helping you attain the highest level of dental and overall well-being.

Chunk 157:
My teeth feel fine, do I still need to come in for a check-up?
Yes. Dolphin Dental recommends that you come in regularly to ensure we prevent or catch common dental problems early on, such as gum disease and tooth decay from forming.
I’m pregnant/breastfeeding. Can I still come to my appointment?

Chunk 158:

Yes. Dolphin Dental recommends dental cleanings for pregnant women at 12 and 24 weeks. X-Rays will not be taken unless there is an urgent issue. If you are breastfeeding, please continue to see the dentist/hygienist for your regular preventative care.
How often should I come in for a check-up/cleaning?

Chunk 159:
How often should I come in for a check-up/cleaning?
This depends on the condition of your mouth. It could range anywhere from every 3 months to every 9 months. On average, we typically see patients once every 6 months. Your dentist will determine what schedule is best for you, based on your circumstances.

During your root canal, we will use a local anesthetic to keep you as comfortable as possible during the procedure. Afterwards, some soreness is normal and can be managed using over the counter pain killers/analgesics.

Yes. It is completely safe to have x-rays taken on your teeth during your active orthodontic treatment. It is imperative to regularly come in with braces as they can be a bit tricky to clean!

Chunk 162:
Can you tell me what my plan covers?
As a courtesy, we try our best to verify all codes prior to you coming in to avoid any surprises! Some plans have services available to dental providers to verify your coverage. Unfortunately, some other providers have very strict privacy rules where they will only release this information to the subscriber of the plan, not the dental office. This means it is not always possible for us to verify on your behalf.

Chunk 163:
Why does my insurance plan only cover an exam every 9 months but, my dentist wants me to come every 6?
A dentist’s first priority is your health. Your dentist will first present a plan based on your oral health needs, which may or may not be covered by your dental plan. Your dentist can do their best to work within your plan whenever possible.
If you do not see the answer to your question below, please do not hesitate to contact us at(416) 429-3317and we will be happy to assist you.

Early intervention orthodontics is orthodontic treatment for children starting around the age of 7. Intervening early on can reduce the need for tooth extraction and jaw surgery later on, correct certain problems before they appear, encourage better facial development, shorten the length of time of any orthodontic treatment needed later on, and provide patients with a better overall result in the end.

However, certain issues with dental alignment, bite, and facial development can begin to appear long before the last few adult teeth appear. By correcting any of these problems early on, future orthodontic treatment can be faster and easier, and sometimes even unnecessary! It is important to note that not all orthodontic problems can be solved with early intervention, which is why it is

Hygiene

Chunk 492:
Healthy teeth and gums are the cornerstone of a healthy mouth and a beautiful smile! That is why Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer dental hygiene and teeth cleaning appointments, to help you achieve the optimal oral health you desire. Regular home care, while important, focuses on areas of the teeth above the gum line (called scaling). A professional dental cleaning can not only clean your teeth above the gum line, but below the gum line as well (subgingival scaling and root planing). It is

Chunk 493:
above the gum line, but below the gum line as well (subgingival scaling and root planing). It is only through regular scaling and root planing that tartar, plaque, and bacteria can be removed from hard-to-reach areas below the gum line that home care cannot reach. Regular professional cleanings can help keep your teeth and gums healthy from top to bottom!

Chunk 494:
Regular Hygiene and Teeth Cleanings Help Maintain Optimal Oral Health!
What Happens at a Dental Hygiene and Teeth Cleaning Appointment?

Chunk 496:
Polishing, to remove stains from your teeth.
Fluoridetreatment (if chosen).After your dental cleaning, you will be provided with an option to receive fluoride treatment. Fluoride is a natural mineral that helps strengthen the enamel (outer layer of your teeth) and prevent cavities.

Chunk 497:
Anoral cancer screeningAt each visit we make our best efforts to screen your oral tissues (including the head, neck, and jaw area) for confirmation of health and signs of oral cancer. The goal is to identify mouth cancer in the early stages or even before it turns into cancer, when there is a better chance for treatment and cure.

Chunk 498:
Digital x-rays, when required.Radiography helps us detect cavities in between teeth, assess bone levels, and detect other problems of the oral cavity. Your dental surgeon will decide what type of images you need and how often you need them based on your oral health. Research shows that radiation received from digital x-ray machines is less than the radiation you receive from natural background sources. At Dolphin Dental, we make sure we follow the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) policy.

Chunk 499:
Sealants(if chosen)Sealants are protective coatings that are applied on deep grooves of back teeth to prevent cavity formation in the future. Sealant application is a quick, easy, and painless procedure.
How Often Should You Visit Us for an Oral Hygiene and Check Up Visit?
Cleaning

Chunk 500:
Dolphin Dental understands that each patient will require a different hygiene and checkup schedule. Most people come in for a dental hygiene appointment every 6 months, although some people may benefit from coming in every 3-4 months, while others may be able to visit every 9-12 months. Genetics, home care, grinding habits, and teeth positioning are all key factors. For those patients experiencing gum disease, heavy staining, loose teeth, or heavy calculus buildup, a higher frequency of

Chunk 501:

Root Canal
If you think you might require a root canal, Dolphin Dental is here for you! A root canal treatment can save your natural teeth from extraction and prevent the need for further intervention down the road. Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer root canal therapy so you can achieve optimal oral health and wellness.
What is Root Canal Therapy?
Process

Chunk 521:
Root canal therapy (RCT) is needed when the nerve of a tooth is affected by decay or infection. The most common reasons that a tooth becomes compromised is because of a crack or fracture, a deep cavity, or an injury to the tooth. In order to save the tooth from extraction, the pulp (the living tissue inside the tooth), nerves, bacteria, and any decay are removed, and the resulting space is filled with special, medicated dental materials which restores the tooth to its full function. An injured

Chunk 522:
with special, medicated dental materials which restores the tooth to its full function. An injured tooth that is left untreated can lead to extreme pain, a dental abscess, or possible tooth loss.

Chunk 523:
RCT is the treatment of choice to save a tooth that otherwise would die and have to be removed. Patients often believe that removing a problematic tooth is the only solution, but that is not always the case. Extracting (or pulling) a tooth may often be more costly and can cause significant problems for adjacent teeth.
Root canal treatment is highly successful and usually lasts a lifetime, although on occasion, a tooth may have to be re-treated due to new infections.

Chunk 524:
If you are experiencing any tooth pain and think you might benefit from a root canal, or you have any questions or concerns about the root canal procedure, contact Dolphin Dental at(416) 429-3317and we will be happy to assist you!

If you are looking for an effective orthodontic treatment option to straighten teeth, deal with spaces between your teeth, or address a bite that requires correction, Clear Aligners might be right for you! Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer this virtually invisible solution to help you achieve the healthy, straight, and beautiful smile you desire.
What are Clear Aligners?
Aligners

Chunk 542:
Clear aligners, sometimes referred to as invisible aligners, are clear, plastic, custom made aligners that correct crooked or misaligned teeth. An alternative to older, more visible and/or fixed orthodontic treatments like metal braces, they are virtually invisible and conveniently removable. They are made from special transparent plastic/synthetic material and are custom-designed for each patient to ensure proper fit and a final result that will be a smile that truly fits you! They can be used

Chunk 543:
to ensure proper fit and a final result that will be a smile that truly fits you! They can be used to treat a variety of dental issues, including crowded teeth, overbite, diastema/spacing, underbite, open bite, and misaligned primary (baby) teeth.

Chunk 544:
What is Involved in Clear Aligners Treatment?
Treatment Process

Chunk 545:
At Dolphin Dental, our qualified team will conduct a thorough examination of your mouth and teeth alignment, which will include a digital scan of your mouth, and then provide you with a recommendation. If a clear aligner system is recommended, a custom treatment plan will be designed just for you. After design and fabrication of the clear aligners using digital 3D technology, you will see your dentist every few weeks in order to check your progress and change to the next set of Aligners in your

Chunk 546:
every few weeks in order to check your progress and change to the next set of Aligners in your series. Each aligner moves (realigns) the teeth by a small amount, so multiple sets will be required to slowly move your teeth into the correct position according to your individual treatment plan. Depending on the patient, treatment can take anywhere from six to twenty-four months, sometimes longer. After treatment is complete, a custom clear retainer is made from a mold of the newly straightened

Chunk 547:
After treatment is complete, a custom clear retainer is made from a mold of the newly straightened teeth. Retainers should be worn every night while sleeping to ensure malocclusion does not recur over time. Dolphin Dental will monitor the alignment of your teeth continually, during your regularly scheduled patient visits, and make recommendations if necessary based on the specifics of your case.

Chunk 548:
Straight teeth are healthy teeth! If you think you might benefit from clear aligners and would like to set up a consultation, or you have any questions about clear aligners, please do not hesitate to contact us at(416) 429-3317and we will be happy to help!

Chunk 583:
TMD/TMJ
If you suffer from constant headaches or neck pain, have trouble opening and closing your mouth when speaking and eating, have noticed that your jaw clicks or pops, and/or have been experiencing radiating pain in your jaw, you might be suffering from TMJ pain, otherwise known as Temporomandibular Dysfunction (TMD).

What is TMJ?
TMJ
The temporomandibular joint, or TMJ, is the joint that connects your lower jaw to your skull on both sides of your head and allows for the opening and closing of your mouth, as well as moving your jaw from side to side. Generally, and for many people, the TMJ works well and causes no problems. Other times, and for some people, problems arise with the TMJ, which can cause extreme pain and affect your overall health.

If you suffer from Bruxism or teeth grinding, or another form of TMD, a custom night guard or splint may be prescribed. Bruxism Grinding Appliances are worn over your upper or lower teeth to realign your jaw and help ease the pain associated with any misalignment. The idea is that by realigning the jaw and preventing the jaw from clicking, it will help alleviate symptoms. The appliance also helps to protect teeth from physical wear and tear involved in the constant teeth grinding of bruxism, so

Bruxism grinding appliances are custom made to fit your unique mouth and will be specially constructed to take into account the severity of your condition; the more you grind, the harder and more sturdy the appliance may be.

If you are looking for an effective orthodontic treatment option to straighten teeth, deal with spaces between your teeth, or address a bite that requires correction, Clear Aligners might be right for you! Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer this virtually invisible solution to help you achieve the healthy, straight, and beautiful smile you desire.
What are Clear Aligners?
Aligners

Chunk 626:
Clear aligners, sometimes referred to as invisible aligners, are clear, plastic, custom made aligners that correct crooked or misaligned teeth. An alternative to older, more visible and/or fixed orthodontic treatments like metal braces, they are virtually invisible and conveniently removable. They are made from special transparent plastic/synthetic material and are custom-designed for each patient to ensure proper fit and a final result that will be a smile that truly fits you! They can be used

Chunk 627:
to ensure proper fit and a final result that will be a smile that truly fits you! They can be used to treat a variety of dental issues, including crowded teeth, overbite, diastema/spacing, underbite, open bite, and misaligned primary (baby) teeth.

Chunk 628:
What is Involved in Clear Aligners Treatment?
Treatment Process

Chunk 629:
At Dolphin Dental, our qualified team will conduct a thorough examination of your mouth and teeth alignment, which will include a digital scan of your mouth, and then provide you with a recommendation. If a clear aligner system is recommended, a custom treatment plan will be designed just for you. After design and fabrication of the clear aligners using digital 3D technology, you will see your dentist every few weeks in order to check your progress and change to the next set of Aligners in your

Chunk 630:
every few weeks in order to check your progress and change to the next set of Aligners in your series. Each aligner moves (realigns) the teeth by a small amount, so multiple sets will be required to slowly move your teeth into the correct position according to your individual treatment plan. Depending on the patient, treatment can take anywhere from six to twenty-four months, sometimes longer. After treatment is complete, a custom clear retainer is made from a mold of the newly straightened

Chunk 631:
After treatment is complete, a custom clear retainer is made from a mold of the newly straightened teeth. Retainers should be worn every night while sleeping to ensure malocclusion does not recur over time. Dolphin Dental will monitor the alignment of your teeth continually, during your regularly scheduled patient visits, and make recommendations if necessary based on the specifics of your case.

Chunk 632:
Straight teeth are healthy teeth! If you think you might benefit from clear aligners and would like to set up a consultation, or you have any questions about clear aligners, please do not hesitate to contact us at(416) 429-3317and we will be happy to help!

What is Cosmetic Dentistry?
Dentistry

Chunk 650:
Cosmetic Dentistry describes any dental procedure that is intended to improve the appearance of your smile (including teeth, gums, and/or bite) by addressing things like colour, shape, size, position, gaps, alignment, or the overall appearance of your smile. The procedures involved may not necessarily address the health or functionality of your smile. Cosmetic dentistry is usually performed for aesthetic reasons. While dentists are always concerned with your overall dental health and having a

aesthetic reasons. While dentists are always concerned with your overall dental health and having a cosmetic procedure done MAY improve your dental health, the procedure is focused on how your mouth will look, rather than how well it functions.

Whitening
Dolphin Dental understands the importance of aesthetics and appearance; we all want a bright and white smile! Unfortunately, things like coffee, tea, red wine, berries, cola, smoking, and general aging can cause staining, yellowing, and general discolouration. With our in-office and take-home teeth whitening, we can help you achieve the bright white smile you have always wanted.

Smile With Confidence With Our East York Dentist Teeth Whitening Service!
In-Office Teeth Whitening
In-Office

Chunk 672:
In-office teeth whitening is performed by a dentist at our clinic. Your dentist will first cover your lips and gums, leaving only your teeth exposed. A hydrogen peroxide gel will be applied to your teeth, and then exposed to a special LED light that activates the gel. The light works to break apart the carbon bonds that create the stains and discolouration, thereby starting the bleaching process, without affecting the structure of your teeth in any way. When the process is complete, you will be

without affecting the structure of your teeth in any way. When the process is complete, you will be left with whiter and brighter teeth. The process typically takes about 60 minutes, and is repeated 3-4 times for best results.

Take-Home Teeth Whitening

Chunk 675:
Take-Home
Take-home teeth whitening offers you a safe and effective way to whiten your teeth at your own convenience, in the privacy of your own home. We send you home with custom made plastic trays that we create using impressions of your teeth, along with a hydrogen peroxide whitening gel. The trays are filled with the gel and worn over teeth for approximately 30 minutes, twice a day. Most patients see excellent results in just two weeks, although individual results can vary.

Chunk 676:
Whichever method you choose, you can expect Dolphin Dental’s teeth whitening services to remove most stains and discolouration quickly, effectively, and safely, so you can achieve the white and bright smile of your dreams.

If you are looking for a way to restore the function and overall aesthetics of discoloured or damaged teeth, dental crowns might be right for you! Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer this cosmetic dental option so you can achieve the smile you desire!
What is a Dental Crown?
Crowns

Chunk 695:
Dental crowns, or caps as they are often referred to, are common dental restorations that cover, or fully ‘cap’, damaged teeth to improve the appearance and health of your teeth. Whether from disease, decay, an accident, wear and tear, stains, or damage, dental crowns can help restore your smile to what it once was. Even extreme damage that seems beyond repair may be corrected with a dental crown. Crowns are made using a variety of materials, including gold alloy, porcelain, zirconia or a

Chunk 696:
crown. Crowns are made using a variety of materials, including gold alloy, porcelain, zirconia or a mixture of these. Dolphin Dental will work closely with you to choose the appropriate crown for your situation.

Chunk 697:
The main difference between a crown and other dental restorations like fillings or inlays and onlays, is that a crown covers the entire tooth that is visible above the gum line and becomes the new outer surface of your tooth. Dental crowns are ideal for teeth with damage, decay, large existing restorations, or teeth that have been treated with root canal therapy.

If you are interested in a solution for one or more missing teeth, a dental bridge might be right for you! Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer this very natural looking restoration option that can replace one or more missing teeth and give you the smile you have always wanted!
What is a Dental Bridge?
Bridge

Chunk 718:
A dental bridge, also known as a fixed partial denture, is a restoration option that is used to replace one tooth, or multiple teeth in the same area. Using abutment teeth to anchor the bridge to, a dental bridge essentially ‘bridges’ or fills in the gap that is left behind from a missing tooth, by placing a false tooth in the area that the gap is. Dental bridges are shaped and coloured just like your natural teeth, so they seamlessly blend in with the rest of your mouth. Adjacent teeth will

Chunk 719:
your natural teeth, so they seamlessly blend in with the rest of your mouth. Adjacent teeth will need to be slightly modified and will be crowned so that the bridge remains in place and your overall bite is stabilized. The end result will be a strong, durable, and aesthetically pleasing solution for missing teeth that can offer your smile back to its original state.

Chunk 720:
If your confidence has been affected because of one or more missing teeth, a dental bridge might be the solution for you. If you would like to learn more about dental bridges, or you are wondering whether you would be a good candidate for a dental bridge, please do not hesitate to contact us(416) 429-3317and we will be happy to help!

Tooth Bonding
If you are looking for an effective way to improve the look of a discoloured, chipped, or cracked tooth, dental bonding might be right for you! Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer dental bonding, so you can achieve the smile you have always wanted.
What is Dental Bonding?
How?

Chunk 760:
What is Dental Bonding?
How?
Dental bonding is an effective cosmetic dental procedure that repairs a decayed, chipped, worn, fractured, or discoloured tooth. A durable tooth-coloured plastic resin is applied to the affected tooth, and then hardened with a special LED light that works to ‘bond’ the material securely to the tooth. Once completed, dental bonding can improve or restore a person’s smile to what it once was.
How Does Dental Bonding Work?
Benefits

Chunk 761:
Dental bonding is a simple and effective procedure that begins with your dentist first cleaning the area where the resin will be applied. Next, a resin that closely matches your natural tooth colour is applied layer by layer to the affected tooth and then molded to the shape of your tooth. The resin is then hardened with a special LED light. Once hardened, any required corrections are made to ensure that the tooth looks correct. The final step in the process involves polishing the tooth. It is

Chunk 762:
that the tooth looks correct. The final step in the process involves polishing the tooth. It is important to note that resin can stain, and is most susceptible to staining within the first few hours following treatment. Consequently, it is important to avoid smoking, as well as drinking things like coffee, tea, or red wine immediately after your procedure.

Chunk 763:
If you have a chipped or cracked tooth, discolouration, or a gap you are interested in correcting, dental bonding might be right for you! If you have any questions about dental bonding, or you would like to set up a consultation to see if dental bonding might be right for you, please do not hesitate to contact us at(416) 225-1991and we will be happy to help!

If you are looking for an effective solution for one or more missing teeth, dental implants might be right for you! Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer the convenience of dental implants as a foundation for replacement teeth that feel, look, and function just like your natural teeth.
What is a Dental Implant?
Implant

Chunk 782:
A dental implant is a small, metal, screw-like titanium post that is permanently placed in your jawbone where missing teeth are, to replace tooth roots. It is fixed into your jaw, bonds to your bone, and creates a very strong foundation on which to mount artificial replacement teeth. Your artificial teeth will look and function much like real ones. Dental implant surgery can offer a welcome alternative to dentures or bridgework that does not fit well and can offer an option for those who lack

Chunk 783:
to dentures or bridgework that does not fit well and can offer an option for those who lack the natural tooth roots to allow building dentures or bridgework.

Chunk 784:
Dental Implant Process
Process
How dental implant surgery is performed depends on the type of implant and the condition of your jawbone. Dental implant surgery may involve several procedures. The major benefit of implants is solid support for your new teeth – a process that requires the bone to heal tightly around the implant.

Chunk 785:
At Dolphin Dental, our experienced surgeons have been providing patients with implants for decades and have advanced training and certifications in implant dentistry. We use only the highest quality materials and improved technology for implant placement.

Chunk 805:
If you have tooth decay or damage that requires treatment, Dolphin Dental is here for you! Decay or damage is usually seen in the form of a cavity, which cannot be ignored, or it can worsen and/or potentially lead to a root canal treatment or extraction. Cavities are most often treated with a filling. White filings are an ideal option to restore the function and shape of teeth, because they seamlessly blend in with the rest of your teeth so no one will know you even have a filling. Let Dolphin

blend in with the rest of your teeth so no one will know you even have a filling. Let Dolphin Dental help you restore your damaged or decayed teeth with white fillings!

Chunk 807:
What is a White Filling?
Fillings
A cavity is an area of the tooth that has decayed and formed a hole. Cavities should be filled by a dentist as soon as possible, or they can grow in size and worsen, and eventually cause unnecessary discomfort, pain, root canal or extraction. Fillings can be used on chipped or worn-down teeth as well,

Chunk 808:
Filling material can be white or have a metallic finish. White fillings, also known as tooth coloured or composite fillings, are an aesthetically pleasing choice since the composite resin material they are made up of is colour matched to seamlessly blend in with the rest of your tooth enamel, while also offering the strength and durability you would expect from a filling.

Chunk 809:
Dolphin Dental is committed to helping you achieve optimal oral health. If you believe you may have a cavity that requires a filling, or you have any questions or concerns about white fillings or the white filling process, please do not hesitate to contact us at(416) 429-3317and we will be happy to help!

Inlays
If your tooth is too damaged to support a filling but is not so damaged that it requires a crown, an inlay or onlay might be right for you. Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer this effective restorative option that allows your teeth to keep their function and natural look!
What is an Inlay and Onlay?
Onlays

Chunk 827:
Inlays and Onlays fill in gaps in teeth when a filling will not work because the tooth is too damaged to support it, and a crown would be too invasive. An inlay fills in cavities and hollows between the cusps, mainly covering the chewing surface of your tooth. An onlay is a more substantial reconstruction, doing more than just filling in cavities on the chewing surface; it also extends out and covers one or more cusps of the tooth. Both are similar to crowns in that they are made from the same

Chunk 828:
one or more cusps of the tooth. Both are similar to crowns in that they are made from the same material and serve the same function. The difference is that, unlike a crown, they do not cover the entire surface of the tooth. Both inlays and onlays are made of porcelain, gold, or composite resin. In recent years porcelain has been increasingly popular as the material of choice because of its strength and colour, which can potentially match the colour of your natural teeth.

Chunk 829:
Benefits of Inlays and Onlays

While adult teeth are meant to last a lifetime, their removal is sometimes recommended or necessary. Dolphin Dental is pleased to be able to provide safe, painless and effective tooth extractions when recommended by your dentist.

Why might a Tooth Need to be Removed?
Why?
While tooth extraction is always a last resort, it may be the best treatment option in certain situations. Severe tooth decay, advanced periodontal disease, or fractures that cannot be repaired are all situations that might call for the removal of a tooth. Some teeth require extraction in advance of orthodontic treatment, or because they are positioned poorly in the mouth.
The Tooth Extraction Process
Process

Chunk 868:
There is no need to worry about pain! Your dentist will first administer local anesthetic to numb the tooth, jawbone, gums and the surrounding area. You will remain completely pain-free and comfortable throughout the procedure, although you may feel some slight pressure during the process. After the tooth is removed, it is not uncommon to experience some mild discomfort immediately after the freezing wears off. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen are recommended at this time. Any bleeding and swelling

Chunk 869:
wears off. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen are recommended at this time. Any bleeding and swelling is usually quite minimal. Your dentist will go over with you exactly what to expect.

What are Wisdom Teeth?
Wisdom Teeth

Chunk 888:
Located in the very back of the mouth, wisdom teeth are the last and final set of molars to appear, usually between the ages of 14-30. Some people never get their wisdom teeth. For many people, wisdom teeth come in properly and cause no issues. For many others however, wisdom teeth can be problematic, and dental intervention is necessary in order to avoid more complications later on. If left untreated, problematic wisdom teeth can lead to gum disease, tooth decay, or occlusion problems, all of

Chunk 889:
problematic wisdom teeth can lead to gum disease, tooth decay, or occlusion problems, all of which can cause extreme pain and discomfort.

Chunk 890:
Why Might Wisdom Teeth Need to Be Removed?
Why?

Chunk 891:
Oftentimes, there is not enough room in the mouth to accommodate the wisdom teeth, which can prevent them from growing in properly. This can result in considerable pain, infection, and chronic headaches. For some, wisdom teeth emerge only partially through the gums, which can result in cavities, gum infection and/or extreme pain. If wisdom teeth grow in an unusual direction, the uneven development can cause complications, including  damage to adjacent molars. The more common reason for removal

Chunk 892:
can cause complications, including  damage to adjacent molars. The more common reason for removal is when there is not enough room for molars to grow in. This is called ‘Impacted’ wisdom teeth. When teeth are impacted, the area around can become a fertile ground for bacteria to grow, which can lead to gum infection, which can ultimately cause a great deal of pain, discomfort, swelling, and illness. Often, it will be recommended that wisdom teeth be removed before they erupt, in order to avoid

Chunk 893:
Often, it will be recommended that wisdom teeth be removed before they erupt, in order to avoid future problems and costly surgical procedures.

Chunk 894:
How Do I Know if My Wisdom Teeth Are Coming In?
Process
Sensitive areas of swelling in the back of the mouth
Frequent headaches that did not occur previously
Pain in the jaw
Having your wisdom teeth removed is not as scary as it seems! Like with any dental procedure, with the right anesthetic, the appropriate tools, and gentle hands, the process is painless and straightforward.

If you are looking for an effective solution for one or more missing teeth, dental implants might be right for you! Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer the convenience of dental implants as a foundation for replacement teeth that feel, look, and function just like your natural teeth.
What is a Dental Implant?
Implant

Chunk 913:
A dental implant is a small, metal, screw-like titanium post that is permanently placed in your jawbone where missing teeth are, to replace tooth roots. It is fixed into your jaw, bonds to your bone, and creates a very strong foundation on which to mount artificial replacement teeth. Your artificial teeth will look and function much like real ones. Dental implant surgery can offer a welcome alternative to dentures or bridgework that does not fit well and can offer an option for those who lack

Chunk 914:
to dentures or bridgework that does not fit well and can offer an option for those who lack the natural tooth roots to allow building dentures or bridgework.

Chunk 915:
Dental Implant Process
Process
How dental implant surgery is performed depends on the type of implant and the condition of your jawbone. Dental implant surgery may involve several procedures. The major benefit of implants is solid support for your new teeth – a process that requires the bone to heal tightly around the implant.

Chunk 916:
At Dolphin Dental, our experienced surgeons have been providing patients with implants for decades and have advanced training and certifications in implant dentistry. We use only the highest quality materials and improved technology for implant placement.

Periodontal
If you notice swollen, red, bleeding gums, and/or any loose teeth, you might be suffering from periodontal disease. Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer periodontal care and a variety of periodontal disease treatment options for patients who suffer from gum disease and want to manage the disease and assorted symptoms.
What is Periodontal Care?
What?

Chunk 937:
Periodontal Care focuses on caring for the gums and surrounding tissue inside of the mouth. Periodontal disease attacks the gums and bone that support teeth. Plaque is a sticky film of food debris, bacteria, and saliva. If plaque is not removed, it turns into calculus (tartar). When plaque and calculus are not removed, they begin to destroy the gums and bone. Periodontal disease is characterized by red, swollen and bleeding gums. Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer a wide variety of periodontal

by red, swollen and bleeding gums. Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer a wide variety of periodontal services to meet all your needs. Treatment recommendations are conservative, and we limit surgery to when it is absolutely necessary. In particularly complex cases, we may refer patients to a specialist.

Early stages of periodontal disease are best treated with nonsurgical therapy. Even in severe cases of periodontal disease, there are nonsurgical therapies that we recommend prior to surgery.

Gum Disease

Chunk 957:
Periodontal (gum) disease affects about 30% of the adult population and is the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. Many denture cases begin because of this chronic condition. Although not curable, with a dedicated professional hygiene regimen and consistent at-home care, it is controllable. Gum disease can advance with few signs or symptoms in the early stages. Many patients diagnosed with this condition experience no pain and are surprised by the quiet yet swift damage that periodontal

Chunk 958:
this condition experience no pain and are surprised by the quiet yet swift damage that periodontal disease leaves in its wake. The gums and bones surrounding teeth provide teeth with structural support, without which, even strong and healthy teeth will become endangered.

Chunk 959:
Regular dental exams, professional cleanings, and good oral hygiene practices at home are essential to detecting and strategically managing periodontal/gum disease.

Chunk 960:
Gum disease (or poor gum health) is associated with a number of serious health conditions – refer to the section on “Oral Health & Overall Health” below – and while the underlying or causal mechanisms are not yet fully understood, experts are unanimous in their view that a healthy mouth and a regimen to keep it that way is a good thing.
What Causes Gum Disease?
Causes

Chunk 961:
Our mouths provide a home to millions of bacteria, both beneficial and harmful. Bacterial waste forms a sticky substance, called plaque, which adheres to teeth. Brushing and flossing aim to remove plaque before it mineralizes into tartar. Tartar becomes a colony for more bacteria releasing toxins into the gums. Gums react to this bacterial invasion with an inflammatory response thanks to your immune system. Around the base of each tooth, there is a small collar of gum tissue that forms a small

Chunk 962:
system. Around the base of each tooth, there is a small collar of gum tissue that forms a small crevice or pocket. This warm, dark environment provides a perfect habitat for deeper tartar and bacteria to infiltrate.

Chunk 963:
Early inflammation results in bleeding gums, known as gingivitis. Bacteria left untreated and undisturbed successfully create a chronic infection in the periodontal pocket. In many cases, the bone begins to deteriorate around the teeth. While gums may be slightly tender at this stage, there is generally minimal discomfort as the bone begins to erode.

Chunk 964:
More than 50% of the bone around your teeth can disappear before any signs of looseness or pain appear. The bone around teeth may never regenerate, so this loss may become permanent and harder to control as the bacteria penetrate deeper into the gums. Untreated gum disease leads to abscesses and generalized tooth loss in many advanced cases.
Diagnosis of Gum Disease
Diagnosis

Chunk 965:
There are several factors to consider before making a gum disease diagnosis. The small collar of gum, or pocket, around each tooth usually sits 2-3 millimeters deep. The Dolphin Dental team can measure and chart multiple areas using a small measuring device called a periodontal probe to detect periodontal disease. In addition, manual inspection of the shape and texture of your gums, and digital x-rays to analyze the bones in the jaw, all help to provide us with a comprehensive picture of the

Chunk 966:
x-rays to analyze the bones in the jaw, all help to provide us with a comprehensive picture of the health of your gums.

Chunk 967:
Treatment of Gum Disease
Treatment
After establishing a diagnosis and defining the severity of gum disease, we can develop a personalized treatment plan. Milder forms with little or no bone loss can be managed with one or two visits with our hygiene team, which may bring the condition under control. When you leave our office with a strategy for daily home care and an established schedule for maintenance, little additional treatment may be needed.

Chunk 968:
If the inflammation has advanced and measurable bone loss is evident, a proactive approach to stop further deterioration should be strongly considered. Often, we will suggest gentle numbing of your gums, and a more in-depth cleaning process sometimes called root planing or deep scaling. Over a few visits, a portion of your mouth at a time will be deep cleaned. The infected pocket around each tooth, including the mineralized tartar, must be carefully cleaned out with hand and ultrasonic

Chunk 969:
tooth, including the mineralized tartar, must be carefully cleaned out with hand and ultrasonic instruments.

Chunk 970:
Dr. Rao and her team will also provide you with other specific strategies to help you with your home care routine, as gum disease can be controlled. Dedicated daily efforts must be consistent to control the disease.
Home Care for Gum Disease
Home Care

Chunk 971:
Home Care for Gum Disease
Home Care
Regular home care is critical to arrest the progression of gum disease. Within a few hours of cleaning, the bacteria begin to repopulate and adhere to the teeth. Plaque left undisturbed will start to harden and mineralize within a day. Routine home care must involve brushing twice a day, flossing once a day, and rinsing your mouth with water after every meal.

Chunk 972:
Since gum pockets previously damaged by bacteria can be difficult to reach at home, a regular maintenance schedule with your dentist and hygienist is essential. Dolphin Dental can customize your plan to include 2, 3 or 4 visits a year depending on the severity of disease, its response to treatment, and the consistency of your home care. If our combined efforts do not slow or stop the progression of your gum disease, we will refer you to a specialist, known as a periodontist. With specialized

of your gum disease, we will refer you to a specialist, known as a periodontist. With specialized training in many gum conditions, they will be able to recommend further treatment.

Oral Health
Research continues to establish clear links between bacterial disease in your mouth and ailments in other parts of the body. Studies show a link between oral bacteria and conditions such as heart disease, stroke, arthritis, Alzheimer’s, and even certain types of cancers. The relationship between a person’s oral health and their whole-body health has never been more understood than it is today.

Chunk 992:
Bleeding gums provide a direct pathway into the bloodstream, a journey that oral bacteria can quickly take. If an open wound existed on your skin, infection would be a concern. Gum tissue that bleeds should be looked at no differently. This helps explain why researchers continue to identify oral bacteria deposits in various areas of our bodies.

Chunk 993:
Diabetes and other auto-immune disorders lower the body’s ability to fight infection, allowing uncontrolled gum disease to advance faster and with more destruction. Research also confirms that the inflammation in the mouth can aggravate diabetes, making it harder to control. This two-way relationship between two chronic conditions emphasizes the importance of optimal oral health.

Chunk 994:
Dolphin Dental encourages patients to take an active role in their oral health, in order to take care of their overall health! With dedication to education, maintenance, and prevention, Dolphin Dental can help you achieve and maintain optimal oral health.

What is Laser Dental Treatment?
What?

Chunk 1012:
All lasers work by delivering energy in the form of extremely focused light beams. When lasers are used for surgical and dental procedures, the lasers serve as a cutting instrument or a vaporizer of tissue that it comes in contact with, and they are used to alter or remove tissue in small amounts. When used during teeth-whitening treatment, the lasers act as a heat source and enhance the effect of tooth-bleaching agents. Dentists use lasers in a variety of situations involving the inside of the

Chunk 1013:
tooth-bleaching agents. Dentists use lasers in a variety of situations involving the inside of the mouth, to remove overgrown tissue, reshape gums, or whiten teeth.

The Canadian Dental Association recommends that children obtain a dental examination within 6 months of the eruption of their first tooth, or by the age of one, whichever comes first. It is important to see children early on, and review important aspects of dental care, health, and diet.

If your child has a damaged or cracked tooth in need of repair, we may recommend a filling, which will help prevent bacteria from entering the crack or damaged area of the tooth. Fillings in children are just as necessary as they are for adults, because untreated cavities can cause discomfort and pain, and cavities can lead to other problems including infection. Extractions may also be necessary, depending on the health of a tooth, whether there is any overcrowding, or in preparation for

Early Intervention Orthodontics
Orthodontics

Chunk 1290:
Early intervention orthodontics is orthodontic treatment for children starting around the age of 7. Intervening early on can reduce the need for tooth extraction and jaw surgery later on, correct certain problems before they appear, encourage better facial development, shorten the length of time of any orthodontic treatment needed later on, and provide patients with a better overall result in the end. Traditional orthodontic treatment begins after most or all of a patient’s adult teeth have

However, certain issues with dental alignment, bite, and facial development can begin to appear long before the last few adult teeth appear. By correcting any of these problems early on, future orthodontic treatment can be faster and easier, and sometimes even unnecessary! It is important to note that not all orthodontic problems can be solved with early intervention, which is why it is

Hygiene

Chunk 1333:
Healthy teeth and gums are the cornerstone of a healthy mouth and a beautiful smile! That is why Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer dental hygiene and teeth cleaning appointments, to help you achieve the optimal oral health you desire. Regular home care, while important, focuses on areas of the teeth above the gum line (called scaling). A professional dental cleaning can not only clean your teeth above the gum line, but below the gum line as well (subgingival scaling and root planing). It is

Chunk 1334:
above the gum line, but below the gum line as well (subgingival scaling and root planing). It is only through regular scaling and root planing that tartar, plaque, and bacteria can be removed from hard-to-reach areas below the gum line that home care cannot reach. Regular professional cleanings can help keep your teeth and gums healthy from top to bottom!

Chunk 1335:
Regular Hygiene and Teeth Cleanings Help Maintain Optimal Oral Health!
What Happens at a Dental Hygiene and Teeth Cleaning Appointment?
Appointment
A complete periodontal assessment
A complete check of your gum tissue, checking for any gum recession, the presence of gingivitis, and other possible gum disease.
An intra-oral exam to check the gum tissue, tongue, and lips for confirmation of health

Chunk 1336:
An intra-oral exam to check the gum tissue, tongue, and lips for confirmation of health
ScalingScaling is a process of removing plaque, tartar (calculus) and bacteria from your teeth so your gums and bone that make up the foundation of your teeth remain healthy and disease free.
Polishing, to remove stains from your teeth.

Chunk 1337:
Polishing, to remove stains from your teeth.
Fluoridetreatment (if chosen).After your dental cleaning, you will be provided with an option to receive fluoride treatment. Fluoride is a natural mineral that helps strengthen the enamel (outer layer of your teeth) and prevent cavities.

Chunk 1338:
Anoral cancer screeningAt each visit we make our best efforts to screen your oral tissues (including the head, neck, and jaw area) for confirmation of health and signs of oral cancer. The goal is to identify mouth cancer in the early stages or even before it turns into cancer, when there is a better chance for treatment and cure.

Chunk 1339:
Digital x-rays, when required.Radiography helps us detect cavities in between teeth, assess bone levels, and detect other problems of the oral cavity. Your dental surgeon will decide what type of images you need and how often you need them based on your oral health. Research shows that radiation received from digital x-ray machines is less than the radiation you receive from natural background sources. At Dolphin Dental, we make sure we follow the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) policy.

Chunk 1340:
Sealants(if chosen)Sealants are protective coatings that are applied on deep grooves of back teeth to prevent cavity formation in the future. Sealant application is a quick, easy, and painless procedure.
How Often Should You Visit Us for an Oral Hygiene and Check Up Visit?
Cleaning

Chunk 1341:
Dolphin Dental understands that each patient will require a different hygiene and checkup schedule. Most people come in for a dental hygiene appointment every 6 months, although some people may benefit from coming in every 3-4 months, while others may be able to visit every 9-12 months. Genetics, home care, grinding habits, and teeth positioning are all key factors. For those patients experiencing gum disease, heavy staining, loose teeth, or heavy calculus buildup, a higher frequency of

Chunk 1342:
gum disease, heavy staining, loose teeth, or heavy calculus buildup, a higher frequency of cleaning will help keep teeth healthier. We will discuss with you how often you should visit us for a dental cleaning/checkup based on your specific and individual needs.

Chunk 1343:

Root Canal
If you think you might require a root canal, Dolphin Dental is here for you! A root canal treatment can save your natural teeth from extraction and prevent the need for further intervention down the road. Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer root canal therapy so you can achieve optimal oral health and wellness.
What is Root Canal Therapy?
Process

Chunk 1362:
Root canal therapy (RCT) is needed when the nerve of a tooth is affected by decay or infection. The most common reasons that a tooth becomes compromised is because of a crack or fracture, a deep cavity, or an injury to the tooth. In order to save the tooth from extraction, the pulp (the living tissue inside the tooth), nerves, bacteria, and any decay are removed, and the resulting space is filled with special, medicated dental materials which restores the tooth to its full function. An injured

Chunk 1363:
with special, medicated dental materials which restores the tooth to its full function. An injured tooth that is left untreated can lead to extreme pain, a dental abscess, or possible tooth loss.

Chunk 1364:
RCT is the treatment of choice to save a tooth that otherwise would die and have to be removed. Patients often believe that removing a problematic tooth is the only solution, but that is not always the case. Extracting (or pulling) a tooth may often be more costly and can cause significant problems for adjacent teeth.
Root canal treatment is highly successful and usually lasts a lifetime, although on occasion, a tooth may have to be re-treated due to new infections.

Chunk 1365:
If you are experiencing any tooth pain and think you might benefit from a root canal, or you have any questions or concerns about the root canal procedure, contact Dolphin Dental at(416) 429-3317and we will be happy to assist you!
We look forward to hearing from you soon!Call Dolphin Dental at(416) 429-3317to set up your Root Canal Therapyappointmenttoday!

If you are looking for an effective orthodontic treatment option to straighten teeth, deal with spaces between your teeth, or address a bite that requires correction, Clear Aligners might be right for you! Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer this virtually invisible solution to help you achieve the healthy, straight, and beautiful smile you desire.
What are Clear Aligners?
Aligners

Chunk 1383:
Clear aligners, sometimes referred to as invisible aligners, are clear, plastic, custom made aligners that correct crooked or misaligned teeth. An alternative to older, more visible and/or fixed orthodontic treatments like metal braces, they are virtually invisible and conveniently removable. They are made from special transparent plastic/synthetic material and are custom-designed for each patient to ensure proper fit and a final result that will be a smile that truly fits you! They can be used

Chunk 1384:
to ensure proper fit and a final result that will be a smile that truly fits you! They can be used to treat a variety of dental issues, including crowded teeth, overbite, diastema/spacing, underbite, open bite, and misaligned primary (baby) teeth.

Chunk 1385:
What is Involved in Clear Aligners Treatment?
Treatment Process

Chunk 1386:
At Dolphin Dental, our qualified team will conduct a thorough examination of your mouth and teeth alignment, which will include a digital scan of your mouth, and then provide you with a recommendation. If a clear aligner system is recommended, a custom treatment plan will be designed just for you. After design and fabrication of the clear aligners using digital 3D technology, you will see your dentist every few weeks in order to check your progress and change to the next set of Aligners in your

Chunk 1387:
every few weeks in order to check your progress and change to the next set of Aligners in your series. Each aligner moves (realigns) the teeth by a small amount, so multiple sets will be required to slowly move your teeth into the correct position according to your individual treatment plan. Depending on the patient, treatment can take anywhere from six to twenty-four months, sometimes longer. After treatment is complete, a custom clear retainer is made from a mold of the newly straightened

Chunk 1388:
After treatment is complete, a custom clear retainer is made from a mold of the newly straightened teeth. Retainers should be worn every night while sleeping to ensure malocclusion does not recur over time. Dolphin Dental will monitor the alignment of your teeth continually, during your regularly scheduled patient visits, and make recommendations if necessary based on the specifics of your case.

Chunk 1389:
Straight teeth are healthy teeth! If you think you might benefit from clear aligners and would like to set up a consultation, or you have any questions about clear aligners, please do not hesitate to contact us at(416) 429-3317and we will be happy to help!

To guarantee accuracy when dealing with your insurance company, please bring your most up-to-date insurance information with you to your appointment.

Chunk 1566:
Our office prides itself on providing a very high standard of dental care at a very fair price. Please know that dental insurance is intended to cover some, but not all, of the costs of your dental care. Not all dental plans are the same, and not all treatments are eligible or fully reimbursable. Furthermore, insurance companies can sometimes make it difficult for the dental provider to retrieve any extended information. It is, therefore, important to remember that it is ultimately your

We Offer Direct Insurance Billing!
Direct Billing

Chunk 1569:
Direct Billing
We are pleased to offer Direct Billing (also called “Assignment of Benefits”). Our administrative team is happy to electronically submit your insurance papers directly to your insurance company on your behalf and accept their payment directly to our office. You only pay the difference your company will not cover. Unfortunately, there are a few insurance companies that will not allow payment to come to the office, therefore payment in full for services is required.

Chunk 1570:
Please note that despite our efforts, due to the Canadian Personal Privacy Act, we have limited access to any specific information from your dental insurance company regarding your plan. It is your responsibility to know the parameters of your dental coverage plan and to provide our office with accurate and current insurance information.
Insurance
We accept most major insurance providers. Please call Dolphin Dental at(416) 429-3317if you have any inquiries regarding our insurance partners.

When should I bring my child to the dentist for the first time?

The Canadian Dental Association recommends that children obtain a dental examination within 6 months of the eruption of their first tooth, or by the age of one, whichever comes first. It is important to see children early on, and review important aspects of dental care, health, and diet.

Fillings

Chunk 1766:
If your child has a damaged or cracked tooth in need of repair, we may recommend a filling, which will help prevent bacteria from entering the crack or damaged area of the tooth. Fillings in children are just as necessary as they are for adults, because untreated cavities can cause discomfort and pain, and cavities can lead to other problems including infection. Extractions may also be necessary, depending on the health of a tooth, whether there is any overcrowding, or in preparation for

For more complicated procedures your child may be referred to a specialist.

Early Intervention Orthodontics
Orthodontics

Chunk 1772:
Early intervention orthodontics is orthodontic treatment for children starting around the age of 7. Intervening early on can reduce the need for tooth extraction and jaw surgery later on, correct certain problems before they appear, encourage better facial development, shorten the length of time of any orthodontic treatment needed later on, and provide patients with a better overall result in the end. Traditional orthodontic treatment begins after most or all of a patient’s adult teeth have

However, certain issues with dental alignment, bite, and facial development can begin to appear long before the last few adult teeth appear. By correcting any of these problems early on, future orthodontic treatment can be faster and easier, and sometimes even unnecessary! It is important to note that not all orthodontic problems can be solved with early intervention, which is why it is

When should I bring my child to the dentist for the first time?

The Canadian Dental Association recommends that children obtain a dental examination within 6 months of the eruption of their first tooth, or by the age of one, whichever comes first. It is important to see children early on, and review important aspects of dental care, health, and diet.

This is a club your kids will want to be a part of! Our cavity-free club acts as a reward system to help our youngest patients learn and maintain good oral hygiene habits. Every young patient may become a member; all they have to do is take care of their teeth by brushing and flossing daily, and if they come to their appointment and have no cavities, they become a member!

Fillings and Extractions
Fillings

Chunk 1803:
If your child has a damaged or cracked tooth in need of repair, we may recommend a filling, which will help prevent bacteria from entering the crack or damaged area of the tooth. Fillings in children are just as necessary as they are for adults, because untreated cavities can cause discomfort and pain, and cavities can lead to other problems including infection. Extractions may also be necessary, depending on the health of a tooth, whether there is any overcrowding, or in preparation for

depending on the health of a tooth, whether there is any overcrowding, or in preparation for orthodontic treatment later on. Our dentists will discuss with you any recommendations regarding fillings and extractions for your child. Rest assured that should your child require a filling or an extraction, they will remain pain-free, comfortable, and relaxed throughout the entire procedure. For more complicated procedures your child may be referred to a specialist.

Early Intervention Orthodontics
Orthodontics

Chunk 1809:
Early intervention orthodontics is orthodontic treatment for children starting around the age of 7. Intervening early on can reduce the need for tooth extraction and jaw surgery later on, correct certain problems before they appear, encourage better facial development, shorten the length of time of any orthodontic treatment needed later on, and provide patients with a better overall result in the end. Traditional orthodontic treatment begins after most or all of a patient’s adult teeth have

the end. Traditional orthodontic treatment begins after most or all of a patient’s adult teeth have grown in. However, certain issues with dental alignment, bite, and facial development can begin to appear long before the last few adult teeth appear. By correcting any of these problems early on, future orthodontic treatment can be faster and easier, and sometimes even unnecessary! It is important to note that not all orthodontic problems can be solved with early intervention, which is why it is

If you are looking for an effective orthodontic treatment option to straighten teeth, deal with spaces between your teeth, or address a bite that requires correction, Clear Aligners might be right for you! Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer this virtually invisible solution to help you achieve the healthy, straight, and beautiful smile you desire.
What are Clear Aligners?
Aligners

Chunk 2069:
Clear aligners, sometimes referred to as invisible aligners, are clear, plastic, custom made aligners that correct crooked or misaligned teeth. An alternative to older, more visible and/or fixed orthodontic treatments like metal braces, they are virtually invisible and conveniently removable. They are made from special transparent plastic/synthetic material and are custom-designed for each patient to ensure proper fit and a final result that will be a smile that truly fits you! They can be used

Chunk 2070:
to ensure proper fit and a final result that will be a smile that truly fits you! They can be used to treat a variety of dental issues, including crowded teeth, overbite, diastema/spacing, underbite, open bite, and misaligned primary (baby) teeth.

Chunk 2071:
What is Involved in Clear Aligners Treatment?
Treatment Process

Chunk 2072:
At Dolphin Dental, our qualified team will conduct a thorough examination of your mouth and teeth alignment, which will include a digital scan of your mouth, and then provide you with a recommendation. If a clear aligner system is recommended, a custom treatment plan will be designed just for you. After design and fabrication of the clear aligners using digital 3D technology, you will see your dentist every few weeks in order to check your progress and change to the next set of Aligners in your

Chunk 2073:
every few weeks in order to check your progress and change to the next set of Aligners in your series. Each aligner moves (realigns) the teeth by a small amount, so multiple sets will be required to slowly move your teeth into the correct position according to your individual treatment plan. Depending on the patient, treatment can take anywhere from six to twenty-four months, sometimes longer. After treatment is complete, a custom clear retainer is made from a mold of the newly straightened

Chunk 2074:
After treatment is complete, a custom clear retainer is made from a mold of the newly straightened teeth. Retainers should be worn every night while sleeping to ensure malocclusion does not recur over time. Dolphin Dental will monitor the alignment of your teeth continually, during your regularly scheduled patient visits, and make recommendations if necessary based on the specifics of your case.

Chunk 2075:
Straight teeth are healthy teeth! If you think you might benefit from clear aligners and would like to set up a consultation, or you have any questions about clear aligners, please do not hesitate to contact us at(416) 429-3317and we will be happy to help!

If you are looking for a way to restore the function and overall aesthetics of discoloured or damaged teeth, dental crowns might be right for you! Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer this cosmetic dental option so you can achieve the smile you desire!
What is a Dental Crown?
Crowns

Chunk 2093:
Dental crowns, or caps as they are often referred to, are common dental restorations that cover, or fully ‘cap’, damaged teeth to improve the appearance and health of your teeth. Whether from disease, decay, an accident, wear and tear, stains, or damage, dental crowns can help restore your smile to what it once was. Even extreme damage that seems beyond repair may be corrected with a dental crown. Crowns are made using a variety of materials, including gold alloy, porcelain, zirconia or a

Chunk 2094:
crown. Crowns are made using a variety of materials, including gold alloy, porcelain, zirconia or a mixture of these. Dolphin Dental will work closely with you to choose the appropriate crown for your situation.

Chunk 2095:
The main difference between a crown and other dental restorations like fillings or inlays and onlays, is that a crown covers the entire tooth that is visible above the gum line and becomes the new outer surface of your tooth. Dental crowns are ideal for teeth with damage, decay, large existing restorations, or teeth that have been treated with root canal therapy.

If you are looking for an effective solution for one or more missing teeth, dental implants might be right for you! Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer the convenience of dental implants as a foundation for replacement teeth that feel, look, and function just like your natural teeth.
What is a Dental Implant?
Implant

Chunk 2116:
A dental implant is a small, metal, screw-like titanium post that is permanently placed in your jawbone where missing teeth are, to replace tooth roots. It is fixed into your jaw, bonds to your bone, and creates a very strong foundation on which to mount artificial replacement teeth. Your artificial teeth will look and function much like real ones. Dental implant surgery can offer a welcome alternative to dentures or bridgework that does not fit well and can offer an option for those who lack

Chunk 2117:
to dentures or bridgework that does not fit well and can offer an option for those who lack the natural tooth roots to allow building dentures or bridgework.

Chunk 2118:
Dental Implant Process
Process
How dental implant surgery is performed depends on the type of implant and the condition of your jawbone. Dental implant surgery may involve several procedures. The major benefit of implants is solid support for your new teeth – a process that requires the bone to heal tightly around the implant.

Chunk 2119:
At Dolphin Dental, our experienced surgeons have been providing patients with implants for decades and have advanced training and certifications in implant dentistry. We use only the highest quality materials and improved technology for implant placement.

If you notice swollen, red, bleeding gums, and/or any loose teeth, you might be suffering from periodontal disease. Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer periodontal care and a variety of periodontal disease treatment options for patients who suffer from gum disease and want to manage the disease and assorted symptoms.
What is Periodontal Care?
What?

Chunk 2140:
Periodontal Care focuses on caring for the gums and surrounding tissue inside of the mouth. Periodontal disease attacks the gums and bone that support teeth. Plaque is a sticky film of food debris, bacteria, and saliva. If plaque is not removed, it turns into calculus (tartar). When plaque and calculus are not removed, they begin to destroy the gums and bone. Periodontal disease is characterized by red, swollen and bleeding gums. Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer a wide variety of periodontal

Chunk 2141:
by red, swollen and bleeding gums. Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer a wide variety of periodontal services to meet all your needs. Treatment recommendations are conservative, and we limit surgery to when it is absolutely necessary. In particularly complex cases, we may refer patients to a specialist.

Early stages of periodontal disease are best treated with nonsurgical therapy. Even in severe cases of periodontal disease, there are nonsurgical therapies that we recommend prior to surgery.
If you have any questions about periodontal care, or you think you might require periodontal services, please do not hesitate to contact us at(416) 429-3317and will be happy to help!

Root Canal
If you think you might require a root canal, Dolphin Dental is here for you! A root canal treatment can save your natural teeth from extraction and prevent the need for further intervention down the road. Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer root canal therapy so you can achieve optimal oral health and wellness.
What is Root Canal Therapy?
Process

Chunk 2183:
Root canal therapy (RCT) is needed when the nerve of a tooth is affected by decay or infection. The most common reasons that a tooth becomes compromised is because of a crack or fracture, a deep cavity, or an injury to the tooth. In order to save the tooth from extraction, the pulp (the living tissue inside the tooth), nerves, bacteria, and any decay are removed, and the resulting space is filled with special, medicated dental materials which restores the tooth to its full function. An injured

Chunk 2184:
with special, medicated dental materials which restores the tooth to its full function. An injured tooth that is left untreated can lead to extreme pain, a dental abscess, or possible tooth loss.

Chunk 2185:
RCT is the treatment of choice to save a tooth that otherwise would die and have to be removed. Patients often believe that removing a problematic tooth is the only solution, but that is not always the case. Extracting (or pulling) a tooth may often be more costly and can cause significant problems for adjacent teeth.
Root canal treatment is highly successful and usually lasts a lifetime, although on occasion, a tooth may have to be re-treated due to new infections.

Chunk 2186:
If you are experiencing any tooth pain and think you might benefit from a root canal, or you have any questions or concerns about the root canal procedure, contact Dolphin Dental at(416) 429-3317and we will be happy to assist you!

Chunk 2203:
Healthy teeth and gums are the cornerstone of a healthy mouth and a beautiful smile! That is why Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer dental hygiene and teeth cleaning appointments, to help you achieve the optimal oral health you desire. Regular home care, while important, focuses on areas of the teeth above the gum line (called scaling). A professional dental cleaning can not only clean your teeth above the gum line, but below the gum line as well (subgingival scaling and root planing). It is

above the gum line, but below the gum line as well (subgingival scaling and root planing). It is only through regular scaling and root planing that tartar, plaque, and bacteria can be removed from hard-to-reach areas below the gum line that home care cannot reach. Regular professional cleanings can help keep your teeth and gums healthy from top to bottom!

ScalingScaling is a process of removing plaque, tartar (calculus) and bacteria from your teeth so your gums and bone that make up the foundation of your teeth remain healthy and disease free.
Polishing, to remove stains from your teeth.

Chunk 2207:
Polishing, to remove stains from your teeth.
Fluoridetreatment (if chosen).After your dental cleaning, you will be provided with an option to receive fluoride treatment. Fluoride is a natural mineral that helps strengthen the enamel (outer layer of your teeth) and prevent cavities.

Chunk 2208:
Anoral cancer screeningAt each visit we make our best efforts to screen your oral tissues (including the head, neck, and jaw area) for confirmation of health and signs of oral cancer. The goal is to identify mouth cancer in the early stages or even before it turns into cancer, when there is a better chance for treatment and cure.

Chunk 2209:
Digital x-rays, when required.Radiography helps us detect cavities in between teeth, assess bone levels, and detect other problems of the oral cavity. Your dental surgeon will decide what type of images you need and how often you need them based on your oral health. Research shows that radiation received from digital x-ray machines is less than the radiation you receive from natural background sources. At Dolphin Dental, we make sure we follow the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) policy.

Chunk 2210:
Sealants(if chosen)Sealants are protective coatings that are applied on deep grooves of back teeth to prevent cavity formation in the future. Sealant application is a quick, easy, and painless procedure.
How Often Should You Visit Us for an Oral Hygiene and Check Up Visit?

Chunk 2211:
Dolphin Dental understands that each patient will require a different hygiene and checkup schedule. Most people come in for a dental hygiene appointment every 6 months, although some people may benefit from coming in every 3-4 months, while others may be able to visit every 9-12 months. Genetics, home care, grinding habits, and teeth positioning are all key factors. For those patients experiencing gum disease, heavy staining, loose teeth, or heavy calculus buildup, a higher frequency of

Chunk 2212:
gum disease, heavy staining, loose teeth, or heavy calculus buildup, a higher frequency of cleaning will help keep teeth healthier. We will discuss with you how often you should visit us for a dental cleaning/checkup based on your specific and individual needs.

We Are Canada’s Best Dental Marketing Agency

Chunk 2273:
For over 23 years, CPM has been navigating the world of digital marketing for Dentists, Chiropractors and Physiotherapists. As Digital Marketing experts, we know that many existing Marketing companies can often make you feel like you are lost in an ocean of technical jargon, dubious metrics, and “questionable” promotional tactics. At CPM, we hear all the time that digital marketing has become too confusing, unpredictable, and eventually overwhelming – not to mention the out-of-pocket cost with

Chunk 2274:
confusing, unpredictable, and eventually overwhelming – not to mention the out-of-pocket cost with little or no return on your investment.

Chunk 2275:
That is why we have worked hard to ensure we can be your digital compass. We are a Canadian based, digital performance partner – not just another “digital marketing agency.” How? By using the best people and innovative tools that evolve with the industry, rather than a pre-packaged solution. But mostly, we get there by listening. To you, your data, and your patients & clientele.
Effective Practice Management Solutions

Chunk 2276:
Effective Practice Management Solutions
Our Practice Solutions Specialists can assist in the custom design and implementation of office policies. Written policies that speak to the vision of your practice is one the most important things that an office can have.
Practice Goal Setting and KPI metric analysis
Metrics based on industry standards and your own personal goals can be merged in a way that will be suitable for the growth of your practice.

Chunk 2277:
Staff Retention through Team Building and Morale Strategies
Customer service is key in standing out in the dental industry. Happy Team Members usually result in Happier Clients! In today’s dental climate, it may be hard to find and retain great staff. We can help! Allow our PSS to develop a plan to ensure that you keep your team engaged, invested and driven.

Branding & Logo Design
Many clients think that Logo Design and Branding are the same thing. While they are closely related, they are two integral arms to achieving your company’s identity.

Chunk 2285:
A logo is an easily recognizable symbol that identifies your company whereas branding is how you are effectively marketing your company using that symbol. At CPM our expert team of design specialists can help your Logo and Branding purpose.
Branded Merchandise

Branded Merchandise
Branded merchandise, or promotional merchandise, is sets of objects branded with your company’s logo, company name, or specific message. Promotional items can range in value from inexpensive to VIP gifts for your clients, or awards for your team members.

Chunk 2287:
Either way, they are usually distributed to raise awareness of your brand and/or promote an event you may be participating in.

At Dolphin Dental, we are committed to providing our patients with personalized, high-quality dental services at affordable prices, and we follow the most up-to-date Ontario Fee Guide for all our dental services. We understand that Dental Insurance & Finances can be confusing and paying for dental treatment can be stressful, especially if the costs are high.

Chunk 2357:
Dolphin Dental is here to assist you in understanding your insurance plan so you can best utilize your coverage. To guarantee accuracy when dealing with your insurance company, please bring your most up-to-date insurance information with you to your appointment. Dental insurance is a complex subject; while it is not possible for us to know every detail, limit, or exclusion involved in all the plans we deal with, we endeavor to assist you in understanding and navigating coverage details the very

we deal with, we endeavor to assist you in understanding and navigating coverage details the very best we can.

Chunk 2359:
Our office prides itself on providing a very high standard of dental care at a very fair price. Please know that dental insurance is intended to cover some, but not all, of the costs of your dental care. Not all dental plans are the same, and not all treatments are eligible or fully reimbursable. Furthermore, insurance companies can sometimes make it difficult for the dental provider to retrieve any extended information. It is, therefore, important to remember that it is ultimately your

Please note that the treatment we recommend will always be based on your dental needs, regardless of the nature and extent of your dental plan coverage.
We Offer Direct Insurance Billing!
Direct Billing

Chunk 2362:
Direct Billing
We are pleased to offer Direct Billing (also called “Assignment of Benefits”). Our administrative team is happy to electronically submit your insurance papers directly to your insurance company on your behalf and accept their payment directly to our office. You only pay the difference your company will not cover. Unfortunately, there are a few insurance companies that will not allow payment to come to the office, therefore payment in full for services is required.

Chunk 2363:
Please note that despite our efforts, due to the Canadian Personal Privacy Act, we have limited access to any specific information from your dental insurance company regarding your plan. It is your responsibility to know the parameters of your dental coverage plan and to provide our office with accurate and current insurance information.
Insurance
We accept most major insurance providers. Please call Dolphin Dental at(416) 429-3317if you have any inquiries regarding our insurance partners.

Chunk 2364:
Payment
We offer several payment options for your convenience, including Cash, Debit Card, Visa, and MasterCard.

At Dolphin Dental, we believe that the key to a good, respectful, and long-lasting relationship is clarity and consistency. In order to ensure that your next dental appointment is as pleasant and predictable as possible, we would like to give you an overview of our office policies. Please feel free to call us at(416) 429-3317with any questions you may have.

Chunk 2382:
Your East York Choice for All Your Dental Needs!
Reasons

Chunk 2383:
Please understand that it is ultimately your responsibility to keep track of any upcoming dental appointment. As a courtesy, we send outhygiene reminders a few weeks before a requested appointment, and we make confirmation calls or emails two weeks before hygiene appointments. As well, we send a courtesy reminder the day before all appointments. Although we make every effort to contact you before any appointment, it is ultimately your responsibility to ensure that you will be at your

Chunk 2384:
you before any appointment, it is ultimately your responsibility to ensure that you will be at your appointment unless other arrangements have been made in advance with our office.

Chunk 2385:
Due to a continuous high demand for prime appointment times, we require a minimum of 2 business days’ notice per appointment should you need to reschedule or cancel your appointment. Because we value your time, we do not double book our clients. As such, your appointment is a valuable time that the doctor has set aside, especially for you. Where insufficient notice is given, a missed appointment fee may be charged to you, or we may require you to prepay to reserve your next appointment.

Chunk 2386:
Our goal is always to provide you with a pleasant experience. We strive to serve you to the very best of our ability, and we are committed to helping you attain the highest level of dental and overall well-being.
If you have any questions about any of our policies or procedures, please do not hesitate to contact us at(416) 429-3317, or email us atdolphingenie@rogers.com

My teeth feel fine, do I still need to come in for a check-up?

Chunk 2411:
My teeth feel fine, do I still need to come in for a check-up?
Yes. Dolphin Dental recommends that you come in regularly to ensure we prevent or catch common dental problems early on, such as gum disease and tooth decay from forming.
I’m pregnant/breastfeeding. Can I still come to my appointment?

Chunk 2412:
I’m pregnant/breastfeeding. Can I still come to my appointment?
Yes. Dolphin Dental recommends dental cleanings for pregnant women at 12 and 24 weeks. X-Rays will not be taken unless there is an urgent issue. If you are breastfeeding, please continue to see the dentist/hygienist for your regular preventative care.
How often should I come in for a check-up/cleaning?

Chunk 2413:
How often should I come in for a check-up/cleaning?
This depends on the condition of your mouth. It could range anywhere from every 3 months to every 9 months. On average, we typically see patients once every 6 months. Your dentist will determine what schedule is best for you, based on your circumstances.
What is a dental crown?

What is a dental crown?
Adental crownis a covering or ‘cap’ for your damaged tooth. It restores your tooth to its normal shape, size, and function. It is typically recommended for a structurally weak tooth that is at high risk of breaking.

Do Root Canals/Fillings hurt?
During your root canal, we will use a local anesthetic to keep you as comfortable as possible during the procedure. Afterwards, some soreness is normal and can be managed using over the counter pain killers/analgesics.
Can I get x-rays with metal braces?
Yes. It is completely safe to have x-rays taken on your teeth during your active orthodontic treatment. It is imperative to regularly come in with braces as they can be a bit tricky to clean!

Chunk 2416:
Can you tell me what my plan covers?
As a courtesy, we try our best to verify all codes prior to you coming in to avoid any surprises! Some plans have services available to dental providers to verify your coverage. Unfortunately, some other providers have very strict privacy rules where they will only release this information to the subscriber of the plan, not the dental office. This means it is not always possible for us to verify on your behalf.

Chunk 2417:
Why does my insurance plan only cover an exam every 9 months but, my dentist wants me to come every 6?
A dentist’s first priority is your health. Your dentist will first present a plan based on your oral health needs, which may or may not be covered by your dental plan. Your dentist can do their best to work within your plan whenever possible.
If you do not see the answer to your question below, please do not hesitate to contact us at(416) 429-3317and we will be happy to assist you.

However, certain issues with dental alignment, bite, and facial development can begin to appear long before the last few adult teeth appear.

Hygiene

Chunk 2746:
Healthy teeth and gums are the cornerstone of a healthy mouth and a beautiful smile! That is why Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer dental hygiene and teeth cleaning appointments, to help you achieve the optimal oral health you desire. Regular home care, while important, focuses on areas of the teeth above the gum line (called scaling). A professional dental cleaning can not only clean your teeth above the gum line, but below the gum line as well (subgingival scaling and root planing). It is

Chunk 2747:
above the gum line, but below the gum line as well (subgingival scaling and root planing). It is only through regular scaling and root planing that tartar, plaque, and bacteria can be removed from hard-to-reach areas below the gum line that home care cannot reach. Regular professional cleanings can help keep your teeth and gums healthy from top to bottom!

Chunk 2748:
Regular Hygiene and Teeth Cleanings Help Maintain Optimal Oral Health!
What Happens at a Dental Hygiene and Teeth Cleaning Appointment?
Appointment
A complete periodontal assessment
A complete check of your gum tissue, checking for any gum recession, the presence of gingivitis, and other possible gum disease.
An intra-oral exam to check the gum tissue, tongue, and lips for confirmation of health

Chunk 2749:
An intra-oral exam to check the gum tissue, tongue, and lips for confirmation of health
ScalingScaling is a process of removing plaque, tartar (calculus) and bacteria from your teeth so your gums and bone that make up the foundation of your teeth remain healthy and disease free.
Polishing, to remove stains from your teeth.

Chunk 2750:
Polishing, to remove stains from your teeth.
Fluoridetreatment (if chosen).After your dental cleaning, you will be provided with an option to receive fluoride treatment. Fluoride is a natural mineral that helps strengthen the enamel (outer layer of your teeth) and prevent cavities.

Chunk 2751:
Anoral cancer screeningAt each visit we make our best efforts to screen your oral tissues (including the head, neck, and jaw area) for confirmation of health and signs of oral cancer. The goal is to identify mouth cancer in the early stages or even before it turns into cancer, when there is a better chance for treatment and cure.

Chunk 2752:
Digital x-rays, when required.Radiography helps us detect cavities in between teeth, assess bone levels, and detect other problems of the oral cavity. Your dental surgeon will decide what type of images you need and how often you need them based on your oral health. Research shows that radiation received from digital x-ray machines is less than the radiation you receive from natural background sources. At Dolphin Dental, we make sure we follow the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) policy.

Chunk 2753:
Sealants(if chosen)Sealants are protective coatings that are applied on deep grooves of back teeth to prevent cavity formation in the future. Sealant application is a quick, easy, and painless procedure.
How Often Should You Visit Us for an Oral Hygiene and Check Up Visit?
Cleaning

Chunk 2754:
Dolphin Dental understands that each patient will require a different hygiene and checkup schedule. Most people come in for a dental hygiene appointment every 6 months, although some people may benefit from coming in every 3-4 months, while others may be able to visit every 9-12 months. Genetics, home care, grinding habits, and teeth positioning are all key factors. For those patients experiencing gum disease, heavy staining, loose teeth, or heavy calculus buildup, a higher frequency of

Chunk 2755:
gum disease, heavy staining, loose teeth, or heavy calculus buildup, a higher frequency of cleaning will help keep teeth healthier. We will discuss with you how often you should visit us for a dental cleaning/checkup based on your specific and individual needs.

Chunk 2756:

Root Canal
If you think you might require a root canal, Dolphin Dental is here for you! A root canal treatment can save your natural teeth from extraction and prevent the need for further intervention down the road. Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer root canal therapy so you can achieve optimal oral health and wellness.
What is Root Canal Therapy?
Process

Chunk 2775:
Root canal therapy (RCT) is needed when the nerve of a tooth is affected by decay or infection. The most common reasons that a tooth becomes compromised is because of a crack or fracture, a deep cavity, or an injury to the tooth. In order to save the tooth from extraction, the pulp (the living tissue inside the tooth), nerves, bacteria, and any decay are removed, and the resulting space is filled with special, medicated dental materials which restores the tooth to its full function. An injured

Chunk 2776:
with special, medicated dental materials which restores the tooth to its full function. An injured tooth that is left untreated can lead to extreme pain, a dental abscess, or possible tooth loss.

Chunk 2777:
RCT is the treatment of choice to save a tooth that otherwise would die and have to be removed. Patients often believe that removing a problematic tooth is the only solution, but that is not always the case. Extracting (or pulling) a tooth may often be more costly and can cause significant problems for adjacent teeth.
Root canal treatment is highly successful and usually lasts a lifetime, although on occasion, a tooth may have to be re-treated due to new infections.

Chunk 2778:
If you are experiencing any tooth pain and think you might benefit from a root canal, or you have any questions or concerns about the root canal procedure, contact Dolphin Dental at(416) 429-3317and we will be happy to assist you!

What are Clear Aligners?
Aligners

Chunk 2796:
Clear aligners, sometimes referred to as invisible aligners, are clear, plastic, custom made aligners that correct crooked or misaligned teeth. An alternative to older, more visible and/or fixed orthodontic treatments like metal braces, they are virtually invisible and conveniently removable.

Chunk 2797:
to ensure proper fit and a final result that will be a smile that truly fits you! They can be used to treat a variety of dental issues, including crowded teeth, overbite, diastema/spacing, underbite, open bite, and misaligned primary (baby) teeth.

Chunk 2798:
What is Involved in Clear Aligners Treatment?
Treatment Process

Chunk 2799:
At Dolphin Dental, our qualified team will conduct a thorough examination of your mouth and teeth alignment, which will include a digital scan of your mouth, and then provide you with a recommendation. If a clear aligner system is recommended, a custom treatment plan will be designed just for you. After design and fabrication of the clear aligners using digital 3D technology, you will see your dentist every few weeks in order to check your progress and change to the next set of Aligners in your

Chunk 2800:
every few weeks in order to check your progress and change to the next set of Aligners in your series. Each aligner moves (realigns) the teeth by a small amount, so multiple sets will be required to slowly move your teeth into the correct position according to your individual treatment plan. Depending on the patient, treatment can take anywhere from six to twenty-four months, sometimes longer. After treatment is complete, a custom clear retainer is made from a mold of the newly straightened

Chunk 2801:
After treatment is complete, a custom clear retainer is made from a mold of the newly straightened teeth. Retainers should be worn every night while sleeping to ensure malocclusion does not recur over time. Dolphin Dental will monitor the alignment of your teeth continually, during your regularly scheduled patient visits, and make recommendations if necessary based on the specifics of your case.

Chunk 2802:
Straight teeth are healthy teeth! If you think you might benefit from clear aligners and would like to set up a consultation, or you have any questions about clear aligners, please do not hesitate to contact us at(416) 429-3317and we will be happy to help!

TMD/TMJ
If you suffer from constant headaches or neck pain, have trouble opening and closing your mouth when speaking and eating, have noticed that your jaw clicks or pops, and/or have been experiencing radiating pain in your jaw, you might be suffering from TMJ pain, otherwise known as Temporomandibular Dysfunction (TMD).

Chunk 2838:
What is TMJ?
TMJ
The temporomandibular joint, or TMJ, is the joint that connects your lower jaw to your skull on both sides of your head and allows for the opening and closing of your mouth, as well as moving your jaw from side to side. Generally, and for many people, the TMJ works well and causes no problems. Other times, and for some people, problems arise with the TMJ, which can cause extreme pain and affect your overall health.

Chunk 2839:
What is TMD?
TMD
Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD) are problems associated with the movement of the jaw, and pain in and around the jaw. For some people, the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) becomes stressed and overworked. When this happens, it can lead to TMD. Bruxism, which presents as grinding or clenching of the teeth, is one of the most common forms of TMD.

Chunk 2860:
If you suffer from Bruxism or teeth grinding, or another form of TMD, a custom night guard or splint may be prescribed. Bruxism Grinding Appliances are worn over your upper or lower teeth to realign your jaw and help ease the pain associated with any misalignment. The idea is that by realigning the jaw and preventing the jaw from clicking, it will help alleviate symptoms. The appliance also helps to protect teeth from physical wear and tear involved in the constant teeth grinding of bruxism, so

to protect teeth from physical wear and tear involved in the constant teeth grinding of bruxism, so that instead of wearing down the enamel of your teeth, you bite against the appliance. Bruxism grinding appliances are custom made to fit your unique mouth and will be specially constructed to take into account the severity of your condition; the more you grind, the harder and more sturdy the appliance may be.

If you are looking for an effective orthodontic treatment option to straighten teeth, deal with spaces between your teeth, or address a bite that requires correction, Clear Aligners might be right for you! Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer this virtually invisible solution to help you achieve the healthy, straight, and beautiful smile you desire.
What are Clear Aligners?
Aligners

Chunk 2880:
Clear aligners, sometimes referred to as invisible aligners, are clear, plastic, custom made aligners that correct crooked or misaligned teeth. An alternative to older, more visible and/or fixed orthodontic treatments like metal braces, they are virtually invisible and conveniently removable. They are made from special transparent plastic/synthetic material and are custom-designed for each patient to ensure proper fit and a final result that will be a smile that truly fits you! They can be used

Chunk 2881:
to ensure proper fit and a final result that will be a smile that truly fits you! They can be used to treat a variety of dental issues, including crowded teeth, overbite, diastema/spacing, underbite, open bite, and misaligned primary (baby) teeth.

Chunk 2882:
What is Involved in Clear Aligners Treatment?
Treatment Process

Chunk 2883:
At Dolphin Dental, our qualified team will conduct a thorough examination of your mouth and teeth alignment, which will include a digital scan of your mouth, and then provide you with a recommendation. If a clear aligner system is recommended, a custom treatment plan will be designed just for you. After design and fabrication of the clear aligners using digital 3D technology, you will see your dentist every few weeks in order to check your progress and change to the next set of Aligners in your

Chunk 2884:
every few weeks in order to check your progress and change to the next set of Aligners in your series. Each aligner moves (realigns) the teeth by a small amount, so multiple sets will be required to slowly move your teeth into the correct position according to your individual treatment plan. Depending on the patient, treatment can take anywhere from six to twenty-four months, sometimes longer. After treatment is complete, a custom clear retainer is made from a mold of the newly straightened

Chunk 2885:
After treatment is complete, a custom clear retainer is made from a mold of the newly straightened teeth. Retainers should be worn every night while sleeping to ensure malocclusion does not recur over time. Dolphin Dental will monitor the alignment of your teeth continually, during your regularly scheduled patient visits, and make recommendations if necessary based on the specifics of your case.

Chunk 2886:
Straight teeth are healthy teeth! If you think you might benefit from clear aligners and would like to set up a consultation, or you have any questions about clear aligners, please do not hesitate to contact us at(416) 429-3317and we will be happy to help!

Cosmetic Dentistry describes any dental procedure that is intended to improve the appearance of your smile (including teeth, gums, and/or bite) by addressing things like colour, shape, size, position, gaps, alignment, or the overall appearance of your smile. The procedures involved may not necessarily address the health or functionality of your smile. Cosmetic dentistry is usually performed for aesthetic reasons.

aesthetic reasons. While dentists are always concerned with your overall dental health and having a cosmetic procedure done MAY improve your dental health, the procedure is focused on how your mouth will look, rather than how well it functions.

A hydrogen peroxide gel will be applied to your teeth, and then exposed to a special LED light that activates the gel. The light works to break apart the carbon bonds that create the stains and discolouration, thereby starting the bleaching process, without affecting the structure of your teeth in any way. When the process is complete, you will be

without affecting the structure of your teeth in any way. When the process is complete, you will be left with whiter and brighter teeth. The process typically takes about 60 minutes, and is repeated 3-4 times for best results.

If you are looking for a way to restore the function and overall aesthetics of discoloured or damaged teeth, dental crowns might be right for you! Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer this cosmetic dental option so you can achieve the smile you desire!
What is a Dental Crown?
Crowns

Chunk 2949:
Dental crowns, or caps as they are often referred to, are common dental restorations that cover, or fully ‘cap’, damaged teeth to improve the appearance and health of your teeth. Whether from disease, decay, an accident, wear and tear, stains, or damage, dental crowns can help restore your smile to what it once was. Even extreme damage that seems beyond repair may be corrected with a dental crown. Crowns are made using a variety of materials, including gold alloy, porcelain, zirconia or a

Chunk 2950:
crown. Crowns are made using a variety of materials, including gold alloy, porcelain, zirconia or a mixture of these. Dolphin Dental will work closely with you to choose the appropriate crown for your situation.

Chunk 2951:
The main difference between a crown and other dental restorations like fillings or inlays and onlays, is that a crown covers the entire tooth that is visible above the gum line and becomes the new outer surface of your tooth. Dental crowns are ideal for teeth with damage, decay, large existing restorations, or teeth that have been treated with root canal therapy.

If you are interested in a solution for one or more missing teeth, a dental bridge might be right for you! Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer this very natural looking restoration option that can replace one or more missing teeth and give you the smile you have always wanted!
What is a Dental Bridge?
Bridge

Chunk 2972:
A dental bridge, also known as a fixed partial denture, is a restoration option that is used to replace one tooth, or multiple teeth in the same area. Using abutment teeth to anchor the bridge to, a dental bridge essentially ‘bridges’ or fills in the gap that is left behind from a missing tooth, by placing a false tooth in the area that the gap is. Dental bridges are shaped and coloured just like your natural teeth, so they seamlessly blend in with the rest of your mouth. Adjacent teeth will

Chunk 2973:
your natural teeth, so they seamlessly blend in with the rest of your mouth. Adjacent teeth will need to be slightly modified and will be crowned so that the bridge remains in place and your overall bite is stabilized. The end result will be a strong, durable, and aesthetically pleasing solution for missing teeth that can offer your smile back to its original state.

Chunk 2974:
If your confidence has been affected because of one or more missing teeth, a dental bridge might be the solution for you. If you would like to learn more about dental bridges, or you are wondering whether you would be a good candidate for a dental bridge, please do not hesitate to contact us(416) 429-3317and we will be happy to help!

If you are looking for an effective way to improve the look of a discoloured, chipped, or cracked tooth, dental bonding might be right for you! Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer dental bonding, so you can achieve the smile you have always wanted.
What is Dental Bonding?
How?

Chunk 3014:
What is Dental Bonding?
How?
Dental bonding is an effective cosmetic dental procedure that repairs a decayed, chipped, worn, fractured, or discoloured tooth. A durable tooth-coloured plastic resin is applied to the affected tooth, and then hardened with a special LED light that works to ‘bond’ the material securely to the tooth. Once completed, dental bonding can improve or restore a person’s smile to what it once was.
How Does Dental Bonding Work?
Benefits

Chunk 3015:
Dental bonding is a simple and effective procedure that begins with your dentist first cleaning the area where the resin will be applied. Next, a resin that closely matches your natural tooth colour is applied layer by layer to the affected tooth and then molded to the shape of your tooth. The resin is then hardened with a special LED light. Once hardened, any required corrections are made to ensure that the tooth looks correct. The final step in the process involves polishing the tooth. It is

Chunk 3016:
that the tooth looks correct. The final step in the process involves polishing the tooth. It is important to note that resin can stain, and is most susceptible to staining within the first few hours following treatment. Consequently, it is important to avoid smoking, as well as drinking things like coffee, tea, or red wine immediately after your procedure.

Chunk 3017:
If you have a chipped or cracked tooth, discolouration, or a gap you are interested in correcting, dental bonding might be right for you! If you have any questions about dental bonding, or you would like to set up a consultation to see if dental bonding might be right for you, please do not hesitate to contact us at(416) 225-1991and we will be happy to help!

If you are looking for an effective solution for one or more missing teeth, dental implants might be right for you! Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer the convenience of dental implants as a foundation for replacement teeth that feel, look, and function just like your natural teeth.
What is a Dental Implant?
Implant

Chunk 3036:
A dental implant is a small, metal, screw-like titanium post that is permanently placed in your jawbone where missing teeth are, to replace tooth roots. It is fixed into your jaw, bonds to your bone, and creates a very strong foundation on which to mount artificial replacement teeth. Your artificial teeth will look and function much like real ones. Dental implant surgery can offer a welcome alternative to dentures or bridgework that does not fit well and can offer an option for those who lack

Chunk 3037:
to dentures or bridgework that does not fit well and can offer an option for those who lack the natural tooth roots to allow building dentures or bridgework.

Chunk 3038:
Dental Implant Process
Process
How dental implant surgery is performed depends on the type of implant and the condition of your jawbone. Dental implant surgery may involve several procedures. The major benefit of implants is solid support for your new teeth – a process that requires the bone to heal tightly around the implant.

Chunk 3039:
At Dolphin Dental, our experienced surgeons have been providing patients with implants for decades and have advanced training and certifications in implant dentistry. We use only the highest quality materials and improved technology for implant placement.

Fillings

Chunk 3059:
If you have tooth decay or damage that requires treatment, Dolphin Dental is here for you! Decay or damage is usually seen in the form of a cavity, which cannot be ignored, or it can worsen and/or potentially lead to a root canal treatment or extraction. Cavities are most often treated with a filling. White filings are an ideal option to restore the function and shape of teeth, because they seamlessly blend in with the rest of your teeth so no one will know you even have a filling. Let Dolphin

blend in with the rest of your teeth so no one will know you even have a filling. Let Dolphin Dental help you restore your damaged or decayed teeth with white fillings!

Chunk 3061:
What is a White Filling?
Fillings
A cavity is an area of the tooth that has decayed and formed a hole. Cavities should be filled by a dentist as soon as possible, or they can grow in size and worsen, and eventually cause unnecessary discomfort, pain, root canal or extraction. Fillings can be used on chipped or worn-down teeth as well,

Chunk 3062:
Filling material can be white or have a metallic finish. White fillings, also known as tooth coloured or composite fillings, are an aesthetically pleasing choice since the composite resin material they are made up of is colour matched to seamlessly blend in with the rest of your tooth enamel, while also offering the strength and durability you would expect from a filling.

Chunk 3063:
Dolphin Dental is committed to helping you achieve optimal oral health. If you believe you may have a cavity that requires a filling, or you have any questions or concerns about white fillings or the white filling process, please do not hesitate to contact us at(416) 429-3317and we will be happy to help!

Your East York Choice for Porcelain Inlays & Onlays!
Inlays
If your tooth is too damaged to support a filling but is not so damaged that it requires a crown, an inlay or onlay might be right for you. Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer this effective restorative option that allows your teeth to keep their function and natural look!
What is an Inlay and Onlay?
Onlays

Chunk 3081:
Inlays and Onlays fill in gaps in teeth when a filling will not work because the tooth is too damaged to support it, and a crown would be too invasive. An inlay fills in cavities and hollows between the cusps, mainly covering the chewing surface of your tooth. An onlay is a more substantial reconstruction, doing more than just filling in cavities on the chewing surface; it also extends out and covers one or more cusps of the tooth. Both are similar to crowns in that they are made from the same

Chunk 3082:
one or more cusps of the tooth. Both are similar to crowns in that they are made from the same material and serve the same function. The difference is that, unlike a crown, they do not cover the entire surface of the tooth. Both inlays and onlays are made of porcelain, gold, or composite resin. In recent years porcelain has been increasingly popular as the material of choice because of its strength and colour, which can potentially match the colour of your natural teeth.

Extraction
While adult teeth are meant to last a lifetime, their removal is sometimes recommended or necessary. Dolphin Dental is pleased to be able to provide safe, painless and effective tooth extractions when recommended by your dentist.
Why might a Tooth Need to be Removed?
Why?

Chunk 3121:
Why might a Tooth Need to be Removed?
Why?
While tooth extraction is always a last resort, it may be the best treatment option in certain situations. Severe tooth decay, advanced periodontal disease, or fractures that cannot be repaired are all situations that might call for the removal of a tooth. Some teeth require extraction in advance of orthodontic treatment, or because they are positioned poorly in the mouth.
The Tooth Extraction Process
Process

Chunk 3122:
There is no need to worry about pain! Your dentist will first administer local anesthetic to numb the tooth, jawbone, gums and the surrounding area. You will remain completely pain-free and comfortable throughout the procedure, although you may feel some slight pressure during the process. After the tooth is removed, it is not uncommon to experience some mild discomfort immediately after the freezing wears off. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen are recommended at this time. Any bleeding and swelling

Chunk 3123:
wears off. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen are recommended at this time. Any bleeding and swelling is usually quite minimal. Your dentist will go over with you exactly what to expect.

Although extraction is always a last resort, there are circumstances where it is the best course of action. Wisdom teeth extractions is a common procedure, performed regularly. If your wisdom teeth are causing you any problems, Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer safe, effective, and painless wisdom teeth extractions!
What are Wisdom Teeth?
Wisdom Teeth

Chunk 3142:
Located in the very back of the mouth, wisdom teeth are the last and final set of molars to appear, usually between the ages of 14-30. Some people never get their wisdom teeth. For many people, wisdom teeth come in properly and cause no issues. For many others however, wisdom teeth can be problematic, and dental intervention is necessary in order to avoid more complications later on. If left untreated, problematic wisdom teeth can lead to gum disease, tooth decay, or occlusion problems, all of

Chunk 3143:
problematic wisdom teeth can lead to gum disease, tooth decay, or occlusion problems, all of which can cause extreme pain and discomfort.

Chunk 3144:
Why Might Wisdom Teeth Need to Be Removed?
Why?

Chunk 3145:
Oftentimes, there is not enough room in the mouth to accommodate the wisdom teeth, which can prevent them from growing in properly. This can result in considerable pain, infection, and chronic headaches. For some, wisdom teeth emerge only partially through the gums, which can result in cavities, gum infection and/or extreme pain. If wisdom teeth grow in an unusual direction, the uneven development can cause complications, including  damage to adjacent molars. The more common reason for removal

Chunk 3146:
can cause complications, including  damage to adjacent molars. The more common reason for removal is when there is not enough room for molars to grow in. This is called ‘Impacted’ wisdom teeth. When teeth are impacted, the area around can become a fertile ground for bacteria to grow, which can lead to gum infection, which can ultimately cause a great deal of pain, discomfort, swelling, and illness. Often, it will be recommended that wisdom teeth be removed before they erupt, in order to avoid

Chunk 3147:
Often, it will be recommended that wisdom teeth be removed before they erupt, in order to avoid future problems and costly surgical procedures.

Chunk 3148:
How Do I Know if My Wisdom Teeth Are Coming In?

Sensitive areas of swelling in the back of the mouth
Frequent headaches that did not occur previously
Pain in the jaw
Having your wisdom teeth removed is not as scary as it seems! Like with any dental procedure, with the right anesthetic, the appropriate tools, and gentle hands, the process is painless and straightforward.

If you are looking for an effective solution for one or more missing teeth, dental implants might be right for you! Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer the convenience of dental implants as a foundation for replacement teeth that feel, look, and function just like your natural teeth.
What is a Dental Implant?
Implant

Chunk 3167:
A dental implant is a small, metal, screw-like titanium post that is permanently placed in your jawbone where missing teeth are, to replace tooth roots. It is fixed into your jaw, bonds to your bone, and creates a very strong foundation on which to mount artificial replacement teeth. Your artificial teeth will look and function much like real ones. Dental implant surgery can offer a welcome alternative to dentures or bridgework that does not fit well and can offer an option for those who lack

Chunk 3168:
to dentures or bridgework that does not fit well and can offer an option for those who lack the natural tooth roots to allow building dentures or bridgework.

Chunk 3169:
Dental Implant Process
Process
How dental implant surgery is performed depends on the type of implant and the condition of your jawbone. Dental implant surgery may involve several procedures. The major benefit of implants is solid support for your new teeth – a process that requires the bone to heal tightly around the implant.

Chunk 3170:
At Dolphin Dental, our experienced surgeons have been providing patients with implants for decades and have advanced training and certifications in implant dentistry. We use only the highest quality materials and improved technology for implant placement.

Periodontal
If you notice swollen, red, bleeding gums, and/or any loose teeth, you might be suffering from periodontal disease. Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer periodontal care and a variety of periodontal disease treatment options for patients who suffer from gum disease and want to manage the disease and assorted symptoms.
What is Periodontal Care?
What?

Chunk 3191:
Periodontal Care focuses on caring for the gums and surrounding tissue inside of the mouth. Periodontal disease attacks the gums and bone that support teeth. Plaque is a sticky film of food debris, bacteria, and saliva. If plaque is not removed, it turns into calculus (tartar). When plaque and calculus are not removed, they begin to destroy the gums and bone. Periodontal disease is characterized by red, swollen and bleeding gums. Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer a wide variety of periodontal

by red, swollen and bleeding gums. Dolphin Dental is pleased to offer a wide variety of periodontal services to meet all your needs. Treatment recommendations are conservative, and we limit surgery to when it is absolutely necessary. In particularly complex cases, we may refer patients to a specialist.

Gum Disease

Chunk 3211:
Periodontal (gum) disease affects about 30% of the adult population and is the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. Many denture cases begin because of this chronic condition. Although not curable, with a dedicated professional hygiene regimen and consistent at-home care, it is controllable. Gum disease can advance with few signs or symptoms in the early stages. Many patients diagnosed with this condition experience no pain and are surprised by the quiet yet swift damage that periodontal

Chunk 3212:
this condition experience no pain and are surprised by the quiet yet swift damage that periodontal disease leaves in its wake. The gums and bones surrounding teeth provide teeth with structural support, without which, even strong and healthy teeth will become endangered.

Chunk 3213:
Regular dental exams, professional cleanings, and good oral hygiene practices at home are essential to detecting and strategically managing periodontal/gum disease.

Chunk 3214:
Gum disease (or poor gum health) is associated with a number of serious health conditions – refer to the section on “Oral Health & Overall Health” below – and while the underlying or causal mechanisms are not yet fully understood, experts are unanimous in their view that a healthy mouth and a regimen to keep it that way is a good thing.
What Causes Gum Disease?
Causes

Chunk 3215:
Our mouths provide a home to millions of bacteria, both beneficial and harmful. Bacterial waste forms a sticky substance, called plaque, which adheres to teeth. Brushing and flossing aim to remove plaque before it mineralizes into tartar. Tartar becomes a colony for more bacteria releasing toxins into the gums. Gums react to this bacterial invasion with an inflammatory response thanks to your immune system. Around the base of each tooth, there is a small collar of gum tissue that forms a small

Chunk 3216:
system. Around the base of each tooth, there is a small collar of gum tissue that forms a small crevice or pocket. This warm, dark environment provides a perfect habitat for deeper tartar and bacteria to infiltrate.

Chunk 3217:
Early inflammation results in bleeding gums, known as gingivitis. Bacteria left untreated and undisturbed successfully create a chronic infection in the periodontal pocket. In many cases, the bone begins to deteriorate around the teeth. While gums may be slightly tender at this stage, there is generally minimal discomfort as the bone begins to erode.

Chunk 3218:
More than 50% of the bone around your teeth can disappear before any signs of looseness or pain appear. The bone around teeth may never regenerate, so this loss may become permanent and harder to control as the bacteria penetrate deeper into the gums. Untreated gum disease leads to abscesses and generalized tooth loss in many advanced cases.
Diagnosis of Gum Disease
Diagnosis

Chunk 3219:
There are several factors to consider before making a gum disease diagnosis. The small collar of gum, or pocket, around each tooth usually sits 2-3 millimeters deep. The Dolphin Dental team can measure and chart multiple areas using a small measuring device called a periodontal probe to detect periodontal disease. In addition, manual inspection of the shape and texture of your gums, and digital x-rays to analyze the bones in the jaw, all help to provide us with a comprehensive picture of the

Chunk 3220:
x-rays to analyze the bones in the jaw, all help to provide us with a comprehensive picture of the health of your gums.

Chunk 3221:
Treatment of Gum Disease
Treatment
After establishing a diagnosis and defining the severity of gum disease, we can develop a personalized treatment plan. Milder forms with little or no bone loss can be managed with one or two visits with our hygiene team, which may bring the condition under control. When you leave our office with a strategy for daily home care and an established schedule for maintenance, little additional treatment may be needed.

Chunk 3222:
If the inflammation has advanced and measurable bone loss is evident, a proactive approach to stop further deterioration should be strongly considered. Often, we will suggest gentle numbing of your gums, and a more in-depth cleaning process sometimes called root planing or deep scaling. Over a few visits, a portion of your mouth at a time will be deep cleaned. The infected pocket around each tooth, including the mineralized tartar, must be carefully cleaned out with hand and ultrasonic

tooth, including the mineralized tartar, must be carefully cleaned out with hand and ultrasonic instruments.

Chunk 3224:
Dr. Rao and her team will also provide you with other specific strategies to help you with your home care routine, as gum disease can be controlled. Dedicated daily efforts must be consistent to control the disease.
Home Care for Gum Disease
Home Care

Chunk 3225:
Home Care for Gum Disease
Home Care
Regular home care is critical to arrest the progression of gum disease. Within a few hours of cleaning, the bacteria begin to repopulate and adhere to the teeth. Plaque left undisturbed will start to harden and mineralize within a day. Routine home care must involve brushing twice a day, flossing once a day, and rinsing your mouth with water after every meal.

Chunk 3226:
Since gum pockets previously damaged by bacteria can be difficult to reach at home, a regular maintenance schedule with your dentist and hygienist is essential. Dolphin Dental can customize your plan to include 2, 3 or 4 visits a year depending on the severity of disease, its response to treatment, and the consistency of your home care. If our combined efforts do not slow or stop the progression of your gum disease, we will refer you to a specialist, known as a periodontist. With specialized

of your gum disease, we will refer you to a specialist, known as a periodontist. With specialized training in many gum conditions, they will be able to recommend further treatment.

Oral Health
Research continues to establish clear links between bacterial disease in your mouth and ailments in other parts of the body. Studies show a link between oral bacteria and conditions such as heart disease, stroke, arthritis, Alzheimer’s, and even certain types of cancers. The relationship between a person’s oral health and their whole-body health has never been more understood than it is today.

Chunk 3246:
Bleeding gums provide a direct pathway into the bloodstream, a journey that oral bacteria can quickly take. If an open wound existed on your skin, infection would be a concern. Gum tissue that bleeds should be looked at no differently. This helps explain why researchers continue to identify oral bacteria deposits in various areas of our bodies.

Chunk 3247:
Diabetes and other auto-immune disorders lower the body’s ability to fight infection, allowing uncontrolled gum disease to advance faster and with more destruction. Research also confirms that the inflammation in the mouth can aggravate diabetes, making it harder to control. This two-way relationship between two chronic conditions emphasizes the importance of optimal oral health.

Chunk 3248:
Dolphin Dental encourages patients to take an active role in their oral health, in order to take care of their overall health! With dedication to education, maintenance, and prevention, Dolphin Dental can help you achieve and maintain optimal oral health.

What is Laser Dental Treatment?
What?

Chunk 3266:
All lasers work by delivering energy in the form of extremely focused light beams. When lasers are used for surgical and dental procedures, the lasers serve as a cutting instrument or a vaporizer of tissue that it comes in contact with, and they are used to alter or remove tissue in small amounts. When used during teeth-whitening treatment, the lasers act as a heat source and enhance the effect of tooth-bleaching agents. Dentists use lasers in a variety of situations involving the inside of the
