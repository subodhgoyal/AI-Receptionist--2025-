Meet the Doctor
Dr. Saurabh Jha
Dr. Saurabh Jha has been helping people to put their best smiles forward for the past 13 years. Ever since the young age of 12, he wanted to be a dentist, drawing inspiration from his mother (who is a dentist) working tirelessly to cure her patient’s pain and bringing back their smiles.
He completed his dental graduation in 2010 from the prestigious Bharati Vidyapeeth University in Pune and went on to finish his Master’s Programme in Periodontics and Implant Dentistry from Jaipur and was Awarded the Gold Medal for The Best Outgoing Postgraduate student.
He came to Canada with his family in 2017 and is among the top 5% of thousands of foreign-trained dentists who finished the Canadian equivalency exams in under a year. Dr. Saurabh loves educating patients about their dental needs in the simplest of ways, and patients love his soft and calm demeanor.
Dr. Saurabh stumbled upon Burlington on a trip to Niagara, fell in love with the area and its lakeshore, and never looked back. He is proud of his Burlington community and loves the warmth he got from everyone he has crossed paths with. He is proficient in all aspects of dentistry with a focused interest in preventative dentistry, wisdom teeth surgeries, gum and bone regeneration, and using dental implants to restore missing/broken/infected teeth. He has vast experience, having successfully placed and restored over 1500 dental implants, completed 100s of gum and bone regeneration, root canal treatments, and performed over 1500 wisdom teeth extractions.
His passion for dentistry has led him to undertake more than 300 hours of continuing education in different aspects of dentistry, including wisdom teeth, extractions, soft and hard tissue regeneration, dental implants, and sedation. He is trained in working on patients under moderate (nitrous gas) and complete sedation and has completed the Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support and Pediatric Advanced Life Support certifications.
Besides dentistry, he enjoys spending time with his young daughters, traveling, working on his fitness, and experiencing new cuisines from all around the world.

Our Technology
Using the latest dental technology helps provide an accurate diagnosis, positive patient outcomes, and improved treatments. Walkers Line Dental Centre adopts a high-tech approach to dentistry. We use a combination of technology, experience, and old-fashioned courtesy to provide our patients with premium experiences.
How State-of-the-Art Dental Technology Helps
The latest digital imaging software has made it possible to obtain crystal-clear images of the oral cavity, screen patients for potential diseases, generate and share instant records, and perform dental procedures with greater precision and efficiency. Patients are able to benefit from faster results and accurate diagnosis that helps create targeted treatment plans. Our dentists near you are able to deliver enhanced results for preventive, restorative, and cosmetic dentistry.
For example, during a dental emergency, we use advanced 3D imaging to diagnose the cause and administer treatment quickly and efficiently. Modern devices like intraoral cameras, digital 3D scanning, VELscope®, and x-rays help us deliver better patient care.
Dental Technology at Walkers Line Dental Centre
Our dentists in Burlington, ON, use the following dental equipment to enhance the patient experience:
Opalescence Whitening Machine
The opalescence whitening machine uses a specialized gel that eliminates unsightly stains and discolorations and whitens your smile. The patented potassium nitrate fluoride gel is sticky and viscous and stays in place instead of seeping into the soft tissues. Once we evaluate your eligibility for teeth whitening, we use safe, un-tampered, and effective opalescence whitening systems to brighten your smile.
Magnification Loupes
Wearing magnification loupes allows our dentists to focus and identify conditions before they progress. The enhanced vision allows us to perform dental procedures with greater precision and ease.
Dental Lasers
The use of dental lasers helps improve precision, reduce bleeding, eliminate the need for sutures, and help extract teeth and bone with greater accuracy. Dental lasers are used to remove cavities, prepare fillings, treat sensitivity, and whiten teeth. They are also used to treat cold sores, reshape gummy smiles, and remove benign tumors.
Minimum Radiation X-Rays
Diagnostic dental x-rays are associated with low levels of radiation, provide results in minutes, and are extremely safe for adults and children.

Oral Surgery in Burlington, ON
At Walkers Line Dental Centre, we understand that patients may have concerns when they find out they needoral surgery in Burlington, ON. That’s why our dentist near you, Dr. Saurabh Jha, and our entire professional staff are here to provide you with information, guidance, and support throughout the oral surgical process. Oral surgery is typically very routine, with effective results in terms of helping patients achieve and maintain their oral health and wellness.
Common Oral Surgical Procedures
Most oral surgeries are considered common, routine procedures. For example, many young adults undergo oral surgery to extract wisdom teeth that are impacted. In addition, patients may require root canal therapy which involves surgical procedures designed to restore health to an infected tooth and its roots. In many cases, the need for oral surgery is linked to a patient’s continued oral health and wellness. This may include preventing tooth loss or allowing for proper development and structure of teeth in the mouth.
Oral Surgery and Recovery
The recovery time and process from oral surgery are typically quick and straightforward. The most important aspect of recovery in terms of oral surgery is allowing the surgical site to heal. Since our mouths contain bacteria, it’s essential to avoid any behaviors that would disrupt healing and potentially lead to infection or other oral health complications.
Therefore, it’s essential that patients take medication as directed and avoid any strenuous physical activity for a couple of days. In addition, they should brush and floss their teeth carefully as well as eat soft foods at room temperature. Patients should avoid drinking with a straw, consuming alcohol, and all use of tobacco products through either smoking or chewing for as long as is recommended by Dr. Saurabh Jha. If any unexpected symptoms or complications arise, contact our office immediately.
For more information about oral surgery near you, contact our team at Walkers Line Dental Centre. Ourdentist in Burlington, ON, is committed to your overall oral health, including providing necessary surgical procedures to help you achieve and maintain optimal dental well-being. We look forward to hearing from you!

Four kinds of sedation levels range from relaxation to being completely under. Our dentist can help you find the kind of sedation for your needs. With the lightest kind of sedation, you should still be able to drive home afterward.
We will work with you to determine what kind of sedation is right for your situation. Your medical history can determine what kind of medication works for you. We will also go over what will happen during the procedure to help you prepare for the appointment.
Who Can Use Conscious Sedation Dentistry?
Conscious Sedation Dentistry can be a great tool for many patients of all ages, including:
●      Children who do not cooperate
●      People with a low pain tolerance
●      Sensitive teeth
●      Have a bad gag reflex
●      Need a lot of dental work completed
To learn more about Conscious Sedation Dentistry and how it can help you, we encourage you to call Walker’s Line Dental Centre. We are dedicated to helping all patients get the most out of every appointment and work with their specific needs. Call ourdentist near youtoday to learn how we can help you.

Yes, we are delighted to welcome new dental patients to our practice! At Walkers Line Dental Centre, we prioritize excellent oral health for individuals of all ages. Whether you require a routine checkup, teeth cleaning, or specialized dental treatment, our experienced team is here to provide comprehensive care tailored to your needs. Please schedule an appointment with us today and take the first step towards achieving a healthy and beautiful smile.
During your first visit to Walkers Line Dental Centre, our experienceddentist in Burlingtonaims to make you feel comfortable and at ease. Our warm and welcoming staff will greet you and help with any paperwork or insurance forms. You will then consult Dr. Jha to discuss your oral health history, concerns, and goals. We will also conduct comprehensive examinations, including X-rays, to assess your dental health if necessary.
The American Dental Association recommends visiting a dentist for a routine checkup at least once every six months. Regular dental visits help maintain good oral health by allowing Dr. Jha to detect and address potential issues early on. The frequency of visits may vary depending on your specific oral health needs. Some individuals with certain conditions or a higher risk of dental problems may require more frequent visits than others.
At Walkers Line Dental Centre, we understand the importance of prompt dental care during emergencies. We strive to accommodate same-day emergency dentistry appointments whenever possible. Our team is dedicated to promptly addressing urgent dental issues and relieving pain or discomfort. We recommend calling our office early to secure a same-day appointment. Our staff will work diligently to find a suitable time slot for you.
Same-day emergency dentistry near youat Walkers Line Dental Centre is typically recommended for urgent dental situations that require immediate attention to alleviate pain, prevent further damage, or address potential complications. Some examples of dental emergencies that may warrant a same-day appointment include severe toothache, broken or knocked out tooth, abscess, dental infection, lost or damaged dental restoration, injury to soft tissues of the mouth, and profuse bleeding.
The duration of pain and discomfort after wisdom teeth removal can vary greatly. Generally, you can expect discomfort a few days to a week following the procedure. Immediately after the extraction, you may experience swelling, mild to moderate pain, and jaw stiffness. The discomfort gradually subsides over time. Make sure to follow the postoperative instructions from our dentists to speed up healing.
While dental sealants provide an effective barrier against cavities, they could be more foolproof. Although rare, it is still possible to develop cavities underneath or around sealants if they are not properly maintained. Regular brushing, flossing, and dental checkups are crucial to ensure the integrity of the sealants and detect any signs of decay. Additionally, a balanced diet low in sugary and acidic foods can help minimize the risk of cavities.
Bone grafting is not always needed before a dental implant surgery. However, bone grafting may be required if your jawbone lacks sufficient density or volume to support an implant. The procedure involves adding bone graft material to the deficient area, stimulating new bone growth, and creating a solid foundation for the implant. Our Walkers Line, Dental Centre dentist, will evaluate your situation through imaging and examinations to determine if bone grafting is necessary.
Generally,dental veneers in Burlingtonare considered cosmetic dental treatments suitable for adults with fully developed and matured teeth. It is best to get veneers in late adolescence or early adulthood. However, age is not the sole determining factor. The decision to get veneers should be based on other factors like dental health and aesthetic goals and should be done under the guidance of an experienced dentist like Dr. Jha for best results.
The fastest natural way to whiten teeth is by maintaining efficient oral hygiene practices and avoiding bad dietary habits that can stain teeth. Regularly brushing teeth with whitening toothpaste, flossing, and using mouthwash can help remove surface stains. Additionally, crunchy fruits and vegetables like pears, apples, and carrots can help naturally scrub plaque and surface stains. It is essential to note that natural methods may have limited effectiveness.

Schedule appointments for everyone in your family at Walkers Line Dental Centre. Dr. Saurabh Jha understands that oral health practices start at a young age and continue through adulthood.
What Are Dental Bridges?
Dental bridges are teeth replacements that are permanently connected to your mouth. They typically replace a group of teeth and help keep your facial structure intact. Getting dental bridges not only helps you feel better about your smile but can also help improve the function of your teeth overall.
Getting dental bridges near you at Walkers Line Dental Centre requires the bridge to be built from measurements of your mouth. Additional room may have to be made to ensure the bridge fits correctly. During the procedure, the surrounding area may be numbed and cleaned before the bridge is bonded.
Once the bridge is bonded, Dr. Saurabh Jha will continue to work with you through the recovery process and beyond. We will help you develop strategies to keep your bridges and teeth healthy and beautiful for many years.
Why Choose Dental Bridges?
Dental Bridges can be the right choice for you and your oral health for several reasons, including to:
Replace missing teeth
Cover a gap in teeth
Restore facial structure
Improve eating and speaking abilities
If you are looking for assistance with dental bridges, we encourage you to call ourBurlington family dentist. We are excited to help you get the healthy and beautiful smile of your dreams. Call today to book an appointment with Dr. Saurabh Jha.

By combining multiple operational components of a dental office, I can go to ADIT for most of the practices basic needs.I don't have to go through several companies to run a dental office. I can login into my ADIT app and access all the data I need to continue to drive growth and performance with staff.I also like that we go to ONE single software for multiple uses.
Dr. Glenn
I love that I have a dedicated account manager and team that is super responsive and collaborative.The offerings are always expanding with new features and capabilities… and without any add on costs! I think Adit must have plans to take over the market space for all things dental. It’s such a great way to simplify what could be contracts and systems from a large number of vendors.
Jenn C.
Adit is EXTREMELY helpful with new patient acquisition. The ability to sort data and see, in real-time, what is happening at our practices is invaluable. Their reporting and support is really great too.The software allowed me to get rid of a lot of stand-alone products that I was having to log into and maintain (and pay for!)

Meet the Doctor
Dr. Saurabh Jha
Dr. Saurabh Jha has been helping people to put their best smiles forward for the past 13 years. Ever since the young age of 12, he wanted to be a dentist, drawing inspiration from his mother (who is a dentist) working tirelessly to cure her patient’s pain and bringing back their smiles.
He completed his dental graduation in 2010 from the prestigious Bharati Vidyapeeth University in Pune and went on to finish his Master’s Programme in Periodontics and Implant Dentistry from Jaipur and was Awarded the Gold Medal for The Best Outgoing Postgraduate student.
He came to Canada with his family in 2017 and is among the top 5% of thousands of foreign-trained dentists who finished the Canadian equivalency exams in under a year. Dr. Saurabh loves educating patients about their dental needs in the simplest of ways, and patients love his soft and calm demeanor.
Dr. Saurabh stumbled upon Burlington on a trip to Niagara, fell in love with the area and its lakeshore, and never looked back. He is proud of his Burlington community and loves the warmth he got from everyone he has crossed paths with. He is proficient in all aspects of dentistry with a focused interest in preventative dentistry, wisdom teeth surgeries, gum and bone regeneration, and using dental implants to restore missing/broken/infected teeth. He has vast experience, having successfully placed and restored over 1500 dental implants, completed 100s of gum and bone regeneration, root canal treatments, and performed over 1500 wisdom teeth extractions.
His passion for dentistry has led him to undertake more than 300 hours of continuing education in different aspects of dentistry, including wisdom teeth, extractions, soft and hard tissue regeneration, dental implants, and sedation. He is trained in working on patients under moderate (nitrous gas) and complete sedation and has completed the Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support and Pediatric Advanced Life Support certifications.
Besides dentistry, he enjoys spending time with his young daughters, traveling, working on his fitness, and experiencing new cuisines from all around the world.

Our Technology
Using the latest dental technology helps provide an accurate diagnosis, positive patient outcomes, and improved treatments. Walkers Line Dental Centre adopts a high-tech approach to dentistry. We use a combination of technology, experience, and old-fashioned courtesy to provide our patients with premium experiences.
How State-of-the-Art Dental Technology Helps
The latest digital imaging software has made it possible to obtain crystal-clear images of the oral cavity, screen patients for potential diseases, generate and share instant records, and perform dental procedures with greater precision and efficiency. Patients are able to benefit from faster results and accurate diagnosis that helps create targeted treatment plans. Our dentists near you are able to deliver enhanced results for preventive, restorative, and cosmetic dentistry.
For example, during a dental emergency, we use advanced 3D imaging to diagnose the cause and administer treatment quickly and efficiently. Modern devices like intraoral cameras, digital 3D scanning, VELscope®, and x-rays help us deliver better patient care.
Dental Technology at Walkers Line Dental Centre
Our dentists in Burlington, ON, use the following dental equipment to enhance the patient experience:
Opalescence Whitening Machine
The opalescence whitening machine uses a specialized gel that eliminates unsightly stains and discolorations and whitens your smile. The patented potassium nitrate fluoride gel is sticky and viscous and stays in place instead of seeping into the soft tissues. Once we evaluate your eligibility for teeth whitening, we use safe, un-tampered, and effective opalescence whitening systems to brighten your smile.
Magnification Loupes
Wearing magnification loupes allows our dentists to focus and identify conditions before they progress. The enhanced vision allows us to perform dental procedures with greater precision and ease.
Dental Lasers
The use of dental lasers helps improve precision, reduce bleeding, eliminate the need for sutures, and help extract teeth and bone with greater accuracy. Dental lasers are used to remove cavities, prepare fillings, treat sensitivity, and whiten teeth. They are also used to treat cold sores, reshape gummy smiles, and remove benign tumors.
Minimum Radiation X-Rays
Diagnostic dental x-rays are associated with low levels of radiation, provide results in minutes, and are extremely safe for adults and children.

Oral Surgery in Burlington, ON
At Walkers Line Dental Centre, we understand that patients may have concerns when they find out they needoral surgery in Burlington, ON. That’s why our dentist near you, Dr. Saurabh Jha, and our entire professional staff are here to provide you with information, guidance, and support throughout the oral surgical process. Oral surgery is typically very routine, with effective results in terms of helping patients achieve and maintain their oral health and wellness.
Common Oral Surgical Procedures
Most oral surgeries are considered common, routine procedures. For example, many young adults undergo oral surgery to extract wisdom teeth that are impacted. In addition, patients may require root canal therapy which involves surgical procedures designed to restore health to an infected tooth and its roots. In many cases, the need for oral surgery is linked to a patient’s continued oral health and wellness. This may include preventing tooth loss or allowing for proper development and structure of teeth in the mouth.
Oral Surgery and Recovery
The recovery time and process from oral surgery are typically quick and straightforward. The most important aspect of recovery in terms of oral surgery is allowing the surgical site to heal. Since our mouths contain bacteria, it’s essential to avoid any behaviors that would disrupt healing and potentially lead to infection or other oral health complications.
Therefore, it’s essential that patients take medication as directed and avoid any strenuous physical activity for a couple of days. In addition, they should brush and floss their teeth carefully as well as eat soft foods at room temperature. Patients should avoid drinking with a straw, consuming alcohol, and all use of tobacco products through either smoking or chewing for as long as is recommended by Dr. Saurabh Jha. If any unexpected symptoms or complications arise, contact our office immediately.
For more information about oral surgery near you, contact our team at Walkers Line Dental Centre. Ourdentist in Burlington, ON, is committed to your overall oral health, including providing necessary surgical procedures to help you achieve and maintain optimal dental well-being. We look forward to hearing from you!

Yes, we are delighted to welcome new dental patients to our practice! At Walkers Line Dental Centre, we prioritize excellent oral health for individuals of all ages. Whether you require a routine checkup, teeth cleaning, or specialized dental treatment, our experienced team is here to provide comprehensive care tailored to your needs. Please schedule an appointment with us today and take the first step towards achieving a healthy and beautiful smile.
During your first visit to Walkers Line Dental Centre, our experienceddentist in Burlingtonaims to make you feel comfortable and at ease. Our warm and welcoming staff will greet you and help with any paperwork or insurance forms. You will then consult Dr. Jha to discuss your oral health history, concerns, and goals. We will also conduct comprehensive examinations, including X-rays, to assess your dental health if necessary.
The American Dental Association recommends visiting a dentist for a routine checkup at least once every six months. Regular dental visits help maintain good oral health by allowing Dr. Jha to detect and address potential issues early on. The frequency of visits may vary depending on your specific oral health needs. Some individuals with certain conditions or a higher risk of dental problems may require more frequent visits than others.
At Walkers Line Dental Centre, we understand the importance of prompt dental care during emergencies. We strive to accommodate same-day emergency dentistry appointments whenever possible. Our team is dedicated to promptly addressing urgent dental issues and relieving pain or discomfort. We recommend calling our office early to secure a same-day appointment. Our staff will work diligently to find a suitable time slot for you.
Same-day emergency dentistry near youat Walkers Line Dental Centre is typically recommended for urgent dental situations that require immediate attention to alleviate pain, prevent further damage, or address potential complications. Some examples of dental emergencies that may warrant a same-day appointment include severe toothache, broken or knocked out tooth, abscess, dental infection, lost or damaged dental restoration, injury to soft tissues of the mouth, and profuse bleeding.
The duration of pain and discomfort after wisdom teeth removal can vary greatly. Generally, you can expect discomfort a few days to a week following the procedure. Immediately after the extraction, you may experience swelling, mild to moderate pain, and jaw stiffness. The discomfort gradually subsides over time. Make sure to follow the postoperative instructions from our dentists to speed up healing.
While dental sealants provide an effective barrier against cavities, they could be more foolproof. Although rare, it is still possible to develop cavities underneath or around sealants if they are not properly maintained. Regular brushing, flossing, and dental checkups are crucial to ensure the integrity of the sealants and detect any signs of decay. Additionally, a balanced diet low in sugary and acidic foods can help minimize the risk of cavities.
Bone grafting is not always needed before a dental implant surgery. However, bone grafting may be required if your jawbone lacks sufficient density or volume to support an implant. The procedure involves adding bone graft material to the deficient area, stimulating new bone growth, and creating a solid foundation for the implant. Our Walkers Line, Dental Centre dentist, will evaluate your situation through imaging and examinations to determine if bone grafting is necessary.
Generally,dental veneers in Burlingtonare considered cosmetic dental treatments suitable for adults with fully developed and matured teeth. It is best to get veneers in late adolescence or early adulthood. However, age is not the sole determining factor. The decision to get veneers should be based on other factors like dental health and aesthetic goals and should be done under the guidance of an experienced dentist like Dr. Jha for best results.
The fastest natural way to whiten teeth is by maintaining efficient oral hygiene practices and avoiding bad dietary habits that can stain teeth. Regularly brushing teeth with whitening toothpaste, flossing, and using mouthwash can help remove surface stains. Additionally, crunchy fruits and vegetables like pears, apples, and carrots can help naturally scrub plaque and surface stains. It is essential to note that natural methods may have limited effectiveness.
