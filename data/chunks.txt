Dr. Saurabh Jha
Dr. Saurabh Jha has been helping people to put their best smiles forward for the past 13 years. Ever since the young age of 12, he wanted to be a dentist, drawing inspiration from his mother (who is a dentist) working tirelessly to cure her patient’s pain and bringing back their smiles.

Chunk 66:
He completed his dental graduation in 2010 from the prestigious Bharati Vidyapeeth University in Pune and went on to finish his Master’s Programme in Periodontics and Implant Dentistry from Jaipur and was Awarded the Gold Medal for The Best Outgoing Postgraduate student.

Chunk 67:
He came to Canada with his family in 2017 and is among the top 5% of thousands of foreign-trained dentists who finished the Canadian equivalency exams in under a year. Dr. Saurabh loves educating patients about their dental needs in the simplest of ways, and patients love his soft and calm demeanor.

Chunk 68:
Dr. Saurabh stumbled upon Burlington on a trip to Niagara, fell in love with the area and its lakeshore, and never looked back. He is proud of his Burlington community and loves the warmth he got from everyone he has crossed paths with. He is proficient in all aspects of dentistry with a focused interest in preventative dentistry, wisdom teeth surgeries, gum and bone regeneration, and using dental implants to restore missing/broken/infected teeth. He has vast experience, having successfully

Chunk 69:
implants to restore missing/broken/infected teeth. He has vast experience, having successfully placed and restored over 1500 dental implants, completed 100s of gum and bone regeneration, root canal treatments, and performed over 1500 wisdom teeth extractions.

Chunk 70:
His passion for dentistry has led him to undertake more than 300 hours of continuing education in different aspects of dentistry, including wisdom teeth, extractions, soft and hard tissue regeneration, dental implants, and sedation. He is trained in working on patients under moderate (nitrous gas) and complete sedation and has completed the Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support and Pediatric Advanced Life Support certifications.

Chunk 71:
Besides dentistry, he enjoys spending time with his young daughters, traveling, working on his fitness, and experiencing new cuisines from all around the world.

Our Technology
Using the latest dental technology helps provide an accurate diagnosis, positive patient outcomes, and improved treatments. Walkers Line Dental Centre adopts a high-tech approach to dentistry. We use a combination of technology, experience, and old-fashioned courtesy to provide our patients with premium experiences.
How State-of-the-Art Dental Technology Helps

Chunk 81:
The latest digital imaging software has made it possible to obtain crystal-clear images of the oral cavity, screen patients for potential diseases, generate and share instant records, and perform dental procedures with greater precision and efficiency. Patients are able to benefit from faster results and accurate diagnosis that helps create targeted treatment plans. Our dentists near you are able to deliver enhanced results for preventive, restorative, and cosmetic dentistry.

Chunk 82:
For example, during a dental emergency, we use advanced 3D imaging to diagnose the cause and administer treatment quickly and efficiently. Modern devices like intraoral cameras, digital 3D scanning, VELscope®, and x-rays help us deliver better patient care.
Dental Technology at Walkers Line Dental Centre
Our dentists in Burlington, ON, use the following dental equipment to enhance the patient experience:
Opalescence Whitening Machine

Chunk 83:
Opalescence Whitening Machine
The opalescence whitening machine uses a specialized gel that eliminates unsightly stains and discolorations and whitens your smile. The patented potassium nitrate fluoride gel is sticky and viscous and stays in place instead of seeping into the soft tissues. Once we evaluate your eligibility for teeth whitening, we use safe, un-tampered, and effective opalescence whitening systems to brighten your smile.
Magnification Loupes

Chunk 84:
Magnification Loupes
Wearing magnification loupes allows our dentists to focus and identify conditions before they progress. The enhanced vision allows us to perform dental procedures with greater precision and ease.
Dental Lasers

Chunk 85:
Dental Lasers
The use of dental lasers helps improve precision, reduce bleeding, eliminate the need for sutures, and help extract teeth and bone with greater accuracy. Dental lasers are used to remove cavities, prepare fillings, treat sensitivity, and whiten teeth. They are also used to treat cold sores, reshape gummy smiles, and remove benign tumors.
Minimum Radiation X-Rays

Chunk 86:
Minimum Radiation X-Rays
Diagnostic dental x-rays are associated with low levels of radiation, provide results in minutes, and are extremely safe for adults and children.

Chunk 396:
Oral Surgery and Recovery
The recovery time and process from oral surgery are typically quick and straightforward. The most important aspect of recovery in terms of oral surgery is allowing the surgical site to heal. Since our mouths contain bacteria, it’s essential to avoid any behaviors that would disrupt healing and potentially lead to infection or other oral health complications.

Chunk 397:
Therefore, it’s essential that patients take medication as directed and avoid any strenuous physical activity for a couple of days. In addition, they should brush and floss their teeth carefully as well as eat soft foods at room temperature. Patients should avoid drinking with a straw, consuming alcohol, and all use of tobacco products through either smoking or chewing for as long as is recommended by Dr. Saurabh Jha.

Chunk 512:
Yes, we are delighted to welcome new dental patients to our practice! At Walkers Line Dental Centre, we prioritize excellent oral health for individuals of all ages. Whether you require a routine checkup, teeth cleaning, or specialized dental treatment, our experienced team is here to provide comprehensive care tailored to your needs. Please schedule an appointment with us today and take the first step towards achieving a healthy and beautiful smile.

Chunk 513:
During your first visit to Walkers Line Dental Centre, our experienceddentist in Burlingtonaims to make you feel comfortable and at ease. Our warm and welcoming staff will greet you and help with any paperwork or insurance forms. You will then consult Dr. Jha to discuss your oral health history, concerns, and goals. We will also conduct comprehensive examinations, including X-rays, to assess your dental health if necessary.

Chunk 514:
The American Dental Association recommends visiting a dentist for a routine checkup at least once every six months. Regular dental visits help maintain good oral health by allowing Dr. Jha to detect and address potential issues early on. The frequency of visits may vary depending on your specific oral health needs. Some individuals with certain conditions or a higher risk of dental problems may require more frequent visits than others.

Chunk 515:
At Walkers Line Dental Centre, we understand the importance of prompt dental care during emergencies. We strive to accommodate same-day emergency dentistry appointments whenever possible. Our team is dedicated to promptly addressing urgent dental issues and relieving pain or discomfort. We recommend calling our office early to secure a same-day appointment. Our staff will work diligently to find a suitable time slot for you.

Chunk 516:
Same-day emergency dentistry near youat Walkers Line Dental Centre is typically recommended for urgent dental situations that require immediate attention to alleviate pain, prevent further damage, or address potential complications. Some examples of dental emergencies that may warrant a same-day appointment include severe toothache, broken or knocked out tooth, abscess, dental infection, lost or damaged dental restoration, injury to soft tissues of the mouth, and profuse bleeding.

Chunk 517:
The duration of pain and discomfort after wisdom teeth removal can vary greatly. Generally, you can expect discomfort a few days to a week following the procedure. Immediately after the extraction, you may experience swelling, mild to moderate pain, and jaw stiffness. The discomfort gradually subsides over time. Make sure to follow the postoperative instructions from our dentists to speed up healing.

Chunk 518:
While dental sealants provide an effective barrier against cavities, they could be more foolproof. Although rare, it is still possible to develop cavities underneath or around sealants if they are not properly maintained. Regular brushing, flossing, and dental checkups are crucial to ensure the integrity of the sealants and detect any signs of decay. Additionally, a balanced diet low in sugary and acidic foods can help minimize the risk of cavities.

Chunk 519:
Bone grafting is not always needed before a dental implant surgery. However, bone grafting may be required if your jawbone lacks sufficient density or volume to support an implant. The procedure involves adding bone graft material to the deficient area, stimulating new bone growth, and creating a solid foundation for the implant. Our Walkers Line, Dental Centre dentist, will evaluate your situation through imaging and examinations to determine if bone grafting is necessary.

Chunk 520:
Generally,dental veneers in Burlingtonare considered cosmetic dental treatments suitable for adults with fully developed and matured teeth. It is best to get veneers in late adolescence or early adulthood. However, age is not the sole determining factor. The decision to get veneers should be based on other factors like dental health and aesthetic goals and should be done under the guidance of an experienced dentist like Dr. Jha for best results.

Chunk 521:
The fastest natural way to whiten teeth is by maintaining efficient oral hygiene practices and avoiding bad dietary habits that can stain teeth. Regularly brushing teeth with whitening toothpaste, flossing, and using mouthwash can help remove surface stains. Additionally, crunchy fruits and vegetables like pears, apples, and carrots can help naturally scrub plaque and surface stains. It is essential to note that natural methods may have limited effectiveness.

By combining multiple operational components of a dental office, I can go to ADIT for most of the practices basic needs.I don't have to go through several companies to run a dental office. I can login into my ADIT app and access all the data I need to continue to drive growth and performance with staff.I also like that we go to ONE single software for multiple uses.

I love that I have a dedicated account manager and team that is super responsive and collaborative.The offerings are always expanding with new features and capabilities… and without any add on costs! I think Adit must have plans to take over the market space for all things dental. It’s such a great way to simplify what could be contracts and systems from a large number of vendors.

Their reporting and support is really great too.The software allowed me to get rid of a lot of stand-alone products that I was having to log into and maintain (and pay for!)

What Our Physicians Have To Say
My experience with Adit has been positive from Day 1 and they have ensured that my website and SEO are top-notch. But, the thing that I like the most is how they have been able to provide me an additional service that helps me capture any calls missed from patients; thus increasing my patient capture by 30%.

Chunk 818:
Adit did an excellent job re-designing and branding my clinic’s website. They’ve gone above and beyond to make sure I’m comfortable with the process of marketing my practice online.
Working with Adit has been great, they are very efficient and quick and are always available to answer any questions we have. I would definitely recommend Adit to other physicians!

The team at Adit has allowed my businesses to grow with bringing in more patients through SEO and SEM. I would highly recommend their services.
Adit goes an extra mile with the design and development of the website, ensuring that it is visually attractive and the application Pozative helps us get new patients because it takes up the Google reviews and places it right in the center of the website.

Our Technology
Using the latest dental technology helps provide an accurate diagnosis, positive patient outcomes, and improved treatments. Walkers Line Dental Centre adopts a high-tech approach to dentistry. We use a combination of technology, experience, and old-fashioned courtesy to provide our patients with premium experiences.
How State-of-the-Art Dental Technology Helps

Chunk 879:
The latest digital imaging software has made it possible to obtain crystal-clear images of the oral cavity, screen patients for potential diseases, generate and share instant records, and perform dental procedures with greater precision and efficiency. Patients are able to benefit from faster results and accurate diagnosis that helps create targeted treatment plans. Our dentists near you are able to deliver enhanced results for preventive, restorative, and cosmetic dentistry.

Chunk 880:
For example, during a dental emergency, we use advanced 3D imaging to diagnose the cause and administer treatment quickly and efficiently. Modern devices like intraoral cameras, digital 3D scanning, VELscope®, and x-rays help us deliver better patient care.
Dental Technology at Walkers Line Dental Centre
Our dentists in Burlington, ON, use the following dental equipment to enhance the patient experience:
Opalescence Whitening Machine

Chunk 881:
Opalescence Whitening Machine
The opalescence whitening machine uses a specialized gel that eliminates unsightly stains and discolorations and whitens your smile. The patented potassium nitrate fluoride gel is sticky and viscous and stays in place instead of seeping into the soft tissues. Once we evaluate your eligibility for teeth whitening, we use safe, un-tampered, and effective opalescence whitening systems to brighten your smile.
Magnification Loupes

Chunk 882:
Magnification Loupes
Wearing magnification loupes allows our dentists to focus and identify conditions before they progress. The enhanced vision allows us to perform dental procedures with greater precision and ease.
Dental Lasers

Chunk 883:
Dental Lasers
The use of dental lasers helps improve precision, reduce bleeding, eliminate the need for sutures, and help extract teeth and bone with greater accuracy. Dental lasers are used to remove cavities, prepare fillings, treat sensitivity, and whiten teeth. They are also used to treat cold sores, reshape gummy smiles, and remove benign tumors.
Minimum Radiation X-Rays

Chunk 884:
Minimum Radiation X-Rays
Diagnostic dental x-rays are associated with low levels of radiation, provide results in minutes, and are extremely safe for adults and children.

Oral Surgery and Recovery
The recovery time and process from oral surgery are typically quick and straightforward. The most important aspect of recovery in terms of oral surgery is allowing the surgical site to heal. Since our mouths contain bacteria, it’s essential to avoid any behaviors that would disrupt healing and potentially lead to infection or other oral health complications.

Chunk 1195:
Therefore, it’s essential that patients take medication as directed and avoid any strenuous physical activity for a couple of days. In addition, they should brush and floss their teeth carefully as well as eat soft foods at room temperature. Patients should avoid drinking with a straw, consuming alcohol, and all use of tobacco products through either smoking or chewing for as long as is recommended by Dr. Saurabh Jha. If any unexpected symptoms or complications arise, contact our office

We have been caring for patients of all ages since 2002 by providing a full suite of dentistry services, including surgical wisdom tooth extraction, and we’re here to provide that same care to you and your family too.

Chunk 1207:
At Walkers Line Dental Centre, we understand that patients may have concerns when they find out they need a surgical tooth extraction. That’s why our dentist near you, Dr. Saurabh Jha, and our entire professional staff provide you with information, guidance, and support throughout the wisdom tooth extraction consultation, procedure, and aftercare.
Why Choose Us for Your Surgical Wisdom Tooth Extraction Near You?

Chunk 1208:
Although we’ve performed countless surgical wisdom tooth extractions near you, Dr. Jha and his team will never treat your procedure as anything other than unique and personalized. Many young adults undergo oral surgery to extract wisdom teeth that are impacted. But when you visit us for your consultation and procedure, you’ll notice that we treat you with the respect of an individual patient and acknowledge your personal needs and concerns with individualized care.

Chunk 1209:
For example, you may have questions about the type of sedation dentistry used during your procedure. There are four kinds of sedation levels available that range from relaxation to being entirely under. Dr. Jha and his team will provide the information you need to decide which type of sedation is best for your needs. That way, you’ll know ahead of your surgical wisdom tooth extraction appointment about arrangements that may be needed for transportation from the appointment.

Chunk 1210:
We’ll also provide you with complete aftercare instruction and support. The recovery time for most oral surgery, including wisdom tooth extraction, is typically quick and straightforward. Still, our dental care team will provide you with the information you need for recovery at home before leaving our office. Plus, we’ll provide you with emergency contact information so you can reach us 24/7 during your recovery period.

Yes, we are delighted to welcome new dental patients to our practice! At Walkers Line Dental Centre, we prioritize excellent oral health for individuals of all ages. Whether you require a routine checkup, teeth cleaning, or specialized dental treatment, our experienced team is here to provide comprehensive care tailored to your needs. Please schedule an appointment with us today and take the first step towards achieving a healthy and beautiful smile.

Chunk 1311:
During your first visit to Walkers Line Dental Centre, our experienceddentist in Burlingtonaims to make you feel comfortable and at ease. Our warm and welcoming staff will greet you and help with any paperwork or insurance forms. You will then consult Dr. Jha to discuss your oral health history, concerns, and goals. We will also conduct comprehensive examinations, including X-rays, to assess your dental health if necessary.

Chunk 1312:
The American Dental Association recommends visiting a dentist for a routine checkup at least once every six months. Regular dental visits help maintain good oral health by allowing Dr. Jha to detect and address potential issues early on. The frequency of visits may vary depending on your specific oral health needs. Some individuals with certain conditions or a higher risk of dental problems may require more frequent visits than others.

Chunk 1313:
At Walkers Line Dental Centre, we understand the importance of prompt dental care during emergencies. We strive to accommodate same-day emergency dentistry appointments whenever possible. Our team is dedicated to promptly addressing urgent dental issues and relieving pain or discomfort. We recommend calling our office early to secure a same-day appointment. Our staff will work diligently to find a suitable time slot for you.

Chunk 1314:
Same-day emergency dentistry near youat Walkers Line Dental Centre is typically recommended for urgent dental situations that require immediate attention to alleviate pain, prevent further damage, or address potential complications. Some examples of dental emergencies that may warrant a same-day appointment include severe toothache, broken or knocked out tooth, abscess, dental infection, lost or damaged dental restoration, injury to soft tissues of the mouth, and profuse bleeding.

Chunk 1315:
The duration of pain and discomfort after wisdom teeth removal can vary greatly. Generally, you can expect discomfort a few days to a week following the procedure. Immediately after the extraction, you may experience swelling, mild to moderate pain, and jaw stiffness. The discomfort gradually subsides over time. Make sure to follow the postoperative instructions from our dentists to speed up healing.

Chunk 1316:
While dental sealants provide an effective barrier against cavities, they could be more foolproof. Although rare, it is still possible to develop cavities underneath or around sealants if they are not properly maintained. Regular brushing, flossing, and dental checkups are crucial to ensure the integrity of the sealants and detect any signs of decay. Additionally, a balanced diet low in sugary and acidic foods can help minimize the risk of cavities.

Chunk 1317:
Bone grafting is not always needed before a dental implant surgery. However, bone grafting may be required if your jawbone lacks sufficient density or volume to support an implant. The procedure involves adding bone graft material to the deficient area, stimulating new bone growth, and creating a solid foundation for the implant. Our Walkers Line, Dental Centre dentist, will evaluate your situation through imaging and examinations to determine if bone grafting is necessary.

Chunk 1318:
Generally,dental veneers in Burlingtonare considered cosmetic dental treatments suitable for adults with fully developed and matured teeth. It is best to get veneers in late adolescence or early adulthood. However, age is not the sole determining factor. The decision to get veneers should be based on other factors like dental health and aesthetic goals and should be done under the guidance of an experienced dentist like Dr. Jha for best results.

Chunk 1319:
The fastest natural way to whiten teeth is by maintaining efficient oral hygiene practices and avoiding bad dietary habits that can stain teeth. Regularly brushing teeth with whitening toothpaste, flossing, and using mouthwash can help remove surface stains. Additionally, crunchy fruits and vegetables like pears, apples, and carrots can help naturally scrub plaque and surface stains. It is essential to note that natural methods may have limited effectiveness.
